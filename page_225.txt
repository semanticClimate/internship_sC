Rosa notes that in an accelerated culture our experiences of people, culture, work, nature are often 
“mute, cold and indifferent - even hostile”. He argues that an individual, and the decision makers in 
society, should not be invested in chasing material gains or the evasive rewards of status symbols, 
but should be creating as many opportunities as possible for genuine dialogue. Not with a piano, of 
course (although, that image is now useful). Rosa insists on the fact that the human condition is 
most complete when it lives in resonance with “people, things, matter, history, nature and life as 
such.” It is an approach to life which values openness, simplicity, quality, and authenticity.  
 
Perhaps most bluntly, we should just call it love.314 That state of being where you reach out, 
vulnerable to the other, and are willing to be moved by it. Returning to Rosa, he qualifies, 
“Resonance is not consonance, it requires the active presence of something that is beyond my grasp, 
elusive, and in this sense remains alien.” 
 
We can experience resonance in our love for our work, or in an aesthetic moment. It can arise when 
we find connections and buzz in a community or relationships. Rosa admits that such things are not 
easy to establish, and that the kind of investments of energy and effort have no guaranteed return. 
Yet, if we reflect on what we genuinely crave, it is this sense of being truly present in the moment.  
 
314 Rosa, a modern philosopher with rather metaphorical language, sometimes refers to it as a “vibrant thread” 
[vibrierender Draht].
