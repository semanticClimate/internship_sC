## Summary of IPCC AR6 WGI Chapter 10: Linking Global to Regional Climate Change

The chapter provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how global climate change manifests regionally, emphasizing the interplay between large-scale phenomena and localized processes.

### Executive Summary
Regional climate impacts vary widely despite the global nature of climate change, necessitating assessments tailored to sub-continental and local scales. The chapter integrates observational data, climate models, and process understanding to distinguish between anthropogenic influences and natural variability. It establishes methodologies for subsequent regional analyses of extremes, climatic impact-drivers, and mean climate changes.

### Foundations for Regional Climate Change Information
This section defines critical spatial (sub-continental to local) and temporal (sub-daily to multi-decadal) scales for regional analysis. It identifies key drivers of regional variability, including natural forcings (volcanic eruptions, solar cycles), anthropogenic forcings (greenhouse gases, aerosols), and internal variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation). The integration of diverse data sources—such as paleoclimate records, instrumental observations, and indigenous knowledge—is emphasized to build robust regional climate narratives.

### Using Observations for Regional Climate Information
Observational challenges include data scarcity in mountainous and polar regions, particularly for precipitation measurements. Gridded temperature and precipitation products in data-poor areas rely heavily on interpolation, introducing uncertainty. Regional reanalyses outperform global counterparts in capturing extremes (e.g., precipitation, winds) but are constrained by short time spans and regional model biases. Statistical homogenization methods significantly reduce uncertainties in long-term regional warming estimates.

### Using Models for Regional Climate Information
Global Climate Models (GCMs) provide foundational projections but lack fine regional detail. Regional Climate Models (RCMs) enhance accuracy in complex terrains (e.g., orographic precipitation, coastal systems) at resolutions ≤10 km. Convection-permitting models (≤4 km resolution) improve simulations of sub-daily precipitation extremes and soil-moisture feedbacks. Multi-model ensembles and storyline approaches help manage uncertainties in emissions scenarios and model physics.

### Interplay Between Anthropogenic Change and Internal Variability
Attribution methodologies use "time-sliced" simulations to isolate human influence from natural variability. For example, Mediterranean summer warming is linked to aerosol reductions and greenhouse gas increases. Human-driven temperature signals emerge earlier than precipitation changes, with regional hotspots like the Arctic and tropics showing accelerated warming.

### Combining Approaches for Climate Information
Integrating process-based narratives (e.g., drought mechanisms) with probabilistic projections enhances user relevance. Climate services bridge scientific data and stakeholder needs (e.g., agriculture, urban planning), while co-production with local communities ensures contextual applicability.

### Case Studies in Regional Climate Analysis
- **Cape Town Drought (2015–2017):** Triggered by natural variability (ENSO, Indian Ocean Dipole) and exacerbated by anthropogenic shifts in rainfall patterns.
- **Indian Summer Monsoon:** Declining rainfall intensity but increasing extremes due to aerosol-forced land-sea warming asymmetry.
- **Mediterranean Summer Warming:** Accelerated warming (twice the global average) driven by circulation changes and reduced aerosol cooling.

### Final Remarks
The chapter underscores the need to synthesize diverse data sources while quantifying uncertainties. Improved observational networks in underrepresented regions (e.g., Africa, polar areas) and high-resolution models are critical for actionable climate strategies. Stakeholder engagement ensures information is both credible and usable.
