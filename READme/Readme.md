### Project Overview

I am currently working on **IPCC  Working Group 02, chapter07: Health, wellbeing and the changing structure of communities.** The focus of this project is to develop resources that enhance the understanding of climate-related terminologies and concepts, thereby improving comprehension and application in related studies.

### Objectives

**Summary:** This chapter examines the impacts of climate change on health, well-being, migration, and conflict, highlighting increasing risks such as illnesses, mental health issues, and displacement. It reviews recent studies since the IPCCâ€™s Fifth Assessment Report, focusing on vulnerability, adaptation challenges, and the health co-benefits of mitigation. The chapter expands on mental health, gender aspects, and solution pathways beyond previous reports.

**Wordlist:** This wordlist compiles essential terms and concepts from climate science, derived from IPCC chapters and scientific literature. It aims to clarify complex climate topics by providing clear definitions of key terms related to climate systems, geosciences, and atmospheric processes. This resource is valuable for students, researchers, and professionals engaged in climate change studies.**https://github.com/semanticClimate/internship_sC/blob/suman/wg02chapt07_wordlist.txt**

**Dictionary:** This dictionary provides concise definitions of key terms in climate science, focusing on concepts related to atmospheric, environmental, and ecological processes. It serves as a valuable reference for researchers, students, and professionals seeking a clearer understanding of climate-related terminology. **https://github.com/semanticClimate/internship_sC/blob/suman/wg02chapt07_dict.html**

**TOC Graph:** A TOC graph visually represents the organization and structure of a document, outlining the main topics and sub-topics in a hierarchical manner. It allows readers to easily grasp the flow of content and navigate through the document, helping them locate specific sections, chapters, or points of interest quickly.
