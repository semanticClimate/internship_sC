### Project Overview

I am currently working on **IPCC  Working Group 02, chapter07: Health, wellbeing and the changing structure of communities.** The focus of this project is to develop resources that enhance the understanding of climate-related terminologies and concepts, thereby improving comprehension and application in related studies.

### Objectives

**Summary:** This chapter examines the impacts of climate change on health, well-being, migration, and conflict, highlighting increasing risks such as illnesses, mental health issues, and displacement. It reviews recent studies since the IPCCâ€™s Fifth Assessment Report, focusing on vulnerability, adaptation challenges, and the health co-benefits of mitigation. The chapter expands on mental health, gender aspects, and solution pathways beyond previous reports.
