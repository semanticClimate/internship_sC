Changes are assessed relative to both the recent past (1995–2014) and the 1850–1900 approximation to the pre-industrial period.The projections assessed here are mainly based on a new range of scenarios, the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Among the SSPs, the focus is on the five scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. In the SSP labels, the first number refers to the assumed shared socio-economic pathway, and the second refers to the approximate global effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 2100. Where appropriate, this chapter also assesses new results from CMIP5, which used scenarios based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Additional lines of evidence enter the assessment, especially for change in globally averaged surface air temperature (GSAT) and global mean sea level (GMSL), while assessment for changes in other quantities is mainly based on CMIP6 results. Unless noted otherwise, the assessments assume that there will be no major volcanic eruption in the 21st century. {1.6, 4.2.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, 9.6}TemperatureAssessed future change in GSAT is, for the first time in an IPCC report, explicitly constructed by combining scenario-based projections with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR). Climate forecasts initialized using recent observations have also been used for the period 2019–2028. The inclusion of additional lines of evidence has reduced the assessed uncertainty ranges for each scenario. {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 7.5}In the near term (2021–2040), a 1.5°C increase in the 20-year average of GSAT, relative to the average over the period 1850–1900, is very likely to occur in scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and  more likely than not to occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6.  The threshold-crossing time is defined as the midpoint of the first 20-year period during which the average GSAT exceeds the threshold. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of crossing the 1.5°C threshold lies in the early 2030s. This is in the early part of the likely range (2030–2052) assessed in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5), which assumed continuation of the then-current warming rate; this rate has been confirmed in the AR6. Roughly half of this difference between assessed crossing times arises from a larger historical warming diagnosed in AR6. The other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was assessed as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence). When considering scenarios similar to SSP1-1.9 instead of linear extrapolation, the SR1.5 estimate of when 1.5°C global warming is crossed is close to the central estimate reported here. It is more likely than not  that under SSP1-1.9, GSAT relative to 1850–1900 will remain below 1.6°C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot of 1.5°C global warming of no more than 0.1°C. If climate sensitivity lies near the lower end of the assessed very likely range, crossing the 1.5°C warming threshold is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 (medium confidence). {2.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, 3.3.1, 4.3.4, Box 4.1, 7.5}By 2030, GSAT in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a likelihood between 40% and 60%, across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence). Uncertainty in near-term projections of annual GSAT arises in roughly equal measure from natural internal variability and model uncertainty (high confidence). By contrast, near-term annual GSAT levels depend less on the scenario chosen, consistent with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) assessment. Forecasts initialized from recent observations simulate annual GSAT changes for the period 2019–2028 relative to the recent past that are consistent with the assessed very likely range (high confidence). {4.4.1, Box 4.1}Compared to the recent past (1995–2014), GSAT averaged over the period 2081–2100 is very likely to be higher by 0.2°C–1.0°C in the low-emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 2.4°C–4.8°C in the high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5. Forthe scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0, the correspondingvery likely ranges are 0.5°C–1.5°C, 1.2°C–2.6°C, and 2.0°C–3.7°C, respectively. The uncertainty ranges for the period 2081–2100 continue to be dominated by the uncertainty in ECS and TCR (very high confidence). Emissions-driven simulations for SSP5-8.5 show that carbon-cycle uncertainty is too small to change the assessment of GSAT projections (high confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, 7.5}The CMIP6 models project a wider range of GSAT change than the assessed range (high confidence); furthermore, the CMIP6 GSAT increase tends to be larger than in CMIP5 (very high confidence). About half of the increase in simulated warming has occurred because higher climate sensitivity is more prevalent in CMIP6 than in CMIP5; the other half arises from higher ERF in nominally comparable scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5; medium confidence). In SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, ERF changes also explain about half of the changes in the range of warming (medium confidence). For SSP5-8.5, higher climate sensitivity is the primary reason behind the upper end of the warming being higher than in CMIP5 (medium confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, 7.5.6}While high-warming storylines – those associated with GSAT levels above the upper bound of the assessed  very likely range – are by definition extremely unlikely, they cannot be ruled out. For SSP1-2.6, such a high-warming storyline implies long-term (2081–2100) warming well above, rather than well below, 2°C (high confidence). Irrespective of scenario, high-warming storylines imply changes in many aspects of the climate system that exceed the patterns associated with the central estimate of GSAT changes by up to more than 50% (high confidence). {4.3.4, 4.8}It is virtually certain that the average surface warming will continue to be higher over land than over the ocean and that the surface warming in the Arctic will continue to be more pronounced than the global average over the 21st century. On average, the surface is expected to warm faster over land than over the ocean by a factor of 1.5 (likely range 1.4 to 1.7). The warming pattern likely varies across seasons, with northern high latitudes warming more during boreal winter than summer (medium confidence). Regions with increasing or decreasing year-to-year variability of seasonal mean temperatures will likely increase in their spatial extent. {4.3.1, 4.5.1, 7.4.4}It is very likely that long-term lower-tropospheric warming will be larger in the Arctic than in the global mean. It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It is likely that tropical upper tropospheric warming will be larger than at the tropical surface, but with an uncertain magnitude owing to the effects of natural internal variability and uncertainty in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcing. {4.5.1, 3.3.1.2}PrecipitationAnnual global land precipitation will increase over the 21st century as GSAT increases (high confidence). The likely range of change in globally averaged annual land precipitation during 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 is –0.2 to +4.7% in the low-emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 and 0.9–12.9% in the high-emissions scenario SSP5-8.5, based on all available CMIP6 models. The corresponding likely ranges are 0.0–6.6% in SSP1-2.6, 1.5–8.3% in SSP2-4.5, and 0.5–9.6% in SSP3-7.0. {4.3.1, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, 8.4.1}Precipitation change will exhibit substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast as GSAT increases over the 21st century (high confidence). As warming increases, a larger land area will experience statistically significant increases or decreases in precipitation (medium confidence). Precipitation will very likely increase over high latitudes and the tropical oceans, and likely increase in large parts of the monsoon region, but likely decrease over large parts of the subtropics in response to greenhouse gas-induced warming. Interannual variability of precipitation over many land regions will increase with global warming (medium confidence). {4.5.1, 4.6.1, 8.4.1}Near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain, mainly because of natural internal variability, model uncertainty, and uncertainty in natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcing (medium confidence). In the near term, no discernible differences in precipitation changes are projected between different SSPs (high confidence). The anthropogenic aerosol forcing decreases in most scenarios, contributing to increases in GSAT (medium confidence) and global mean land precipitation (low confidence). {4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.4, 8.5}In response to greenhouse gas-induced warming, it is likely that global land monsoon precipitation will increase, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, although Northern Hemisphere monsoon circulation will likely  weaken. In the long term (2081–2100), monsoon rainfall change will feature a north–south asymmetry characterized by a greater increase in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere and an east–west asymmetry characterized by an increase in Asian-African monsoon regions and a decrease in the North American monsoon region (medium confidence). Near-term changes in global monsoon precipitation and circulation are uncertain due to model uncertainty and internal variability such as Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability and Pacific Decadal Variability (medium confidence). {4.4.1, 4.5.1, 8.4.1, 10.6.3}It is likely that at least one large volcanic eruption will occur during the 21st century. Such an eruption would reduce GSAT for several years, decrease global mean land precipitation, alter monsoon circulation, modify extreme precipitation, and change the profile of many regional climatic impact-drivers. A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections. {Cross-Chapter Box 4.1}Large-scale Circulation and Modes of VariabilityIn the near term, the forced change in Southern Annular Mode in austral summer is likely to be weaker than observed during the late 20th century under all five SSPs assessed.  This is because of the opposing influence in the near- to mid-term from stratospheric ozone recovery and increases in other greenhouse gases on the Southern Hemisphere summertime mid-latitude circulation (high confidence). In the near term, forced changes in the Southern Annular Mode in austral summer are therefore likely to be smaller than changes due to natural internal variability. {4.3.3, 4.4.3}In the long term, the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet is likely to shift poleward and strengthen under SSP5-8.5 relative to 1995–2014.  This is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the Southern Annular Mode index in all seasons relative to 1995–2014. For SSP1-2.6, CMIP6 models project no robust change in the Southern Annular Mode index in the long term. It is likely that wind speeds associated with extratropical cyclones will strengthen in the Southern Hemisphere storm track for SSP5-8.5. {4.5.1, 4.5.3}The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projects a long-term increase in the boreal wintertime Northern Annular Mode index under the high-emissions scenarios of SSP3-7.0 andSSP5-8.5, but regional changes may deviate from a simple shift in the mid-latit ude circulation.  Substantial uncertainty and thus low confidence remain in projecting regional changes in Northern Hemisphere jet streams and storm tracks, especially for the North Atlantic basin in winter; this is due to large natural internal variability, the competing effects of projected upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature gradient changes, and new evidence of weaknesses in simulating past variations in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on seasonal-to-decadal time scales. One exception is the expected decrease in frequency of atmospheric blocking events over Greenland and the North Pacific in boreal winter in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (medium confidence). {4.5.1}Near-term predictions and projections of the sub-polar branch of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) on the decadal time scale have improved in CMP6 models compared to CMIP5 (high confidence). This is likely to be related to a more accurate response to natural forcing in CMIP6 models. Initialization contributes to the reduction of uncertainty and to predicting subpolar sea surface temperature. AMV influences on the nearby regions can be predicted over lead times of 5–8 years (medium  confidence). {4.4.3}It is virtually certain that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in a warmer world. There is no model consensus for a systematic change in intensity of ENSO sea surface temperature variability over the 21st century in any of the SSP scenarios assessed (medium confidence). However, it is very likely that ENSO rainfall variability, used for defining extreme El Niños and La Niñas, will increase significantly, regardless of amplitude changes in ENSO SST variability, by the second half of the 21st century in scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. {4.3.3, 4.5.3, 8.4.2}Cryosphere and OceanUnder the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, it is likely that the Arctic Ocean in September, the month of annual minimum sea ice area, will become practically ice-free (sea ice area less than 1 million km2) averaged over 2081–2100 and all available simulations. Arctic sea ice area in March, the month of annual maximum sea ice area, also decreases in the future under each of the considered scenarios, but to a much lesser degree (in percentage terms) than in September (high confidence). {4.3.2}Under the five scenarios assessed, it is virtually certain that global mean sea level (GMSL) will continue to rise through the 21st century. For the period 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014, GMSL is likely to rise by 0.46–0.74 m under SSP3-7.0 and by 0.30–0.54 m under SSP1-2.6 (medium confidence). For the assessment of change in GMSL, the contribution from land-ice melt has been added offline to the CMIP6-simulated contributions from thermal expansion. {4.3.2. 9.6}It is very likely that the cumulative uptake of carbon by the ocean and by land will increase through to the end of the 21st century. Carbon uptake by land shows greater increases but with greater uncertainties than for ocean carbon uptake. The fraction of emissions absorbed by land and ocean sinks will be smaller under high emissions scenarios than under low emissions scenarios (high confidence). Ocean surface pH will decrease steadily through the 21st century, except for SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 where values decrease until around 2070 and then increase slightly to 2100 (high confidence). {4.3.2, 5.4}Climate Response to Emissions Reduction, Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation ModificationIf strong mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year trends in GSAT wouldlikely emerge during the near term (2021–2040), measured against an assumed non-mitigation scenario such as SSP3-7. 0 and SSP5-8.5. However, the response of many other climate quantities to mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, especially on the regional scale (high confidence). The mitigation benefits for these quantities would emerge only later during the 21st century (high confidence). During the near term, a small fraction of the surface can show cooling under all scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is fully consistent with GSAT increase (high confidence). Events of reduced and increased GSAT trends at decadal time scales will continue to occur in the 21st century but will not affect the centennial warming (very high confidence). {4.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1}Because of the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and GSAT change, the cooling or avoided warming from carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is proportional to the cumulative amount of CO2 removed by CDR (high confidence). The climate system response to net negative CO2 emissions is expected to be delayed by years to centuries. Net negative CO2 emissions due to CDR will not reverse some climate change, such as sea level rise, at least for several centuries (high confidence). The climate effect of a sudden and sustained CDR termination would depend on the amount of CDR-induced cooling prior to termination and the rate of background CO2 emissions at the time of termination (high confidence). {4.6.3, 5.5, 5.6}Solar radiation modification (SRM) could offset some of the effects of anthropogenic warming on global and regional climate, but there would be substantial residual and overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal time scale (high confidence), and there is low confidencein our understanding of the climate response to SRM, specifically at the regional scale.  Since AR5, understanding of the global and regional climate response to SRM has improved, due to modelling work with more sophisticated treatment of aerosol-based SRM options and stratospheric processes. Improved modelling suggests that multiple climate goals could be met simultaneously. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high-emissions scenario such as SSP5-8.5 would cause a rapid climate change (high confidence). However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emissions reductions and CDR would morelikely than not avoid larger rates of warming. {4.6.3}Climate Change Commitment and Change Beyond 2100Earth system modelling experiments since AR5 confirm that the zero CO2  emissions commitment (the additional rise in GSAT after all CO2  emissions cease) is small (likely less than 0.3°C in magnitude) on decadal time scales, but that it may be positive or negative.  There is low confidence in the sign of the zero CO2 emissions commitment. Consistent with SR1.5, the central estimate is taken as zero for assessments of remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels of 1.5°C or 2°C. {4.7.2, 5.5.2}.Overshooting specific global warming levels such as 2°C has effects on the climate system that persist beyond 2100 (medium confidence). Under one scenario including a peak and decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration (SSP5-3.4-OS), some climate metrics such as GSAT begin to decline but do not fully reverse by 2100 to levels prior to the CO2 peak (medium confidence). GMSL continues to rise in all models up to 2100 despite a reduction in CO2 to 2040 levels. {4.6.3, 4.7.1, 4.7.2}Using extended scenarios beyond 2100, projections show likely  warming by 2300, relative to 1850-1900, of 1.0°C-2.2°C for SSP1-2.6 and 6.6°C-14.1°C for SSP5-8.5. By 2300, warming under the SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario decreases from a peak around year 2060 to a level very similar to SSP1-2.6. Precipitation over land continues to increase strongly under SSP5-8.5. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP2-4.5 (likely 2.3°C–4.6°C higher than over the period 1850–1900) has not been experienced since the mid-Pliocene, about 3 million years ago. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (likely 6.6°C–14.1°C higher than over the period 1850–1900) overlaps with the range estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum (5°C–10°C higher) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (10°C–18°C higher), about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively (medium confidence). {2.3.1.1, 4.7.1}4.1 Scope and Overview of This ChapterThis chapter assesses simulations of future climate change, covering both near-term and long-term global changes. The chapter assesses simulations of physical indicators of global climate change, such as global surface air temperature (GSAT), global land precipitation, Arctic sea ice area (SIA), and global mean sea level (GMSL). Furthermore, the chapter covers indices and patterns of properties and circulation not only for mean fields but also for modes of variability that have global significance. The choice of quantities to be assessed is summarized in Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and comprises a subset of the quantities covered in Chapters 2 and 3. This chapter provides consistent coverage from near-term to long-term global changes and provides the global reference for the later chapters covering important processes and regional change.Essential input to the simulations assessed here is provided by future scenarios of concentrations or anthropogenic emissions of radiatively active substances; the scenarios represent possible sets of decisions by humanity, without any assessment that one set of decisions is more probable to occur than any other set (Section 1.6). As in previous assessment reports, these scenarios are used for projections of future climate using global atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs; Section 1.5.3); the latter include representation of various biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon cycle, the sulphur cycle, or ozone (e.g., Flato, 2011; Flato et al., 2013). This chapter thus provides a comprehensive assessment of the future global climate response to different future anthropogenic perturbations to the climate system.Every projection assessment is conditioned on a particular forcing scenario. If sufficient evidence is available, a detailed probabilistic assessment of a physical climate outcome can be performed for each scenario separately. By contrast, there is no agreed-upon approach to assigning probabilities to forcing scenarios, to the point that it has been debated whether such an approach can even exist (e.g., Grübler and Nakicenovic, 2001; Schneider, 2001, 2002). Although there were some recent attempts to ascribe subjective probabilities to scenarios (e.g., Ho et al., 2019; Hausfather and Peters, 2020), and although ‘feasibility’ along different dimensions is an important concept in scenario research (see AR6 WGIII Chapter 3), the scenarios used for the model-based projections assessed in this chapter do not come with statements about their likelihood of actually unfolding in the future. Therefore, it is usually not possible to combine responses to individual scenarios into an overall probabilistic statement about expected future climate. Exceptions to this limit in the assessment are possible only under special circumstances, such as for some statements about near-term climate changes that are largely independent of the scenario chosen (e.g., Section 4.4.1). Beyond this, no combination of responses to different scenarios can be assessed in this chapter but may be possible in future assessments.A central element of this chapter is a comprehensive assessment of the sources of uncertainty of future projections (Section 1.4.3). Uncertainty can be broken down into scenario uncertainty, model uncertainty involving model biases, uncertainty in simulated effective radiative forcing and model response, and the uncertainty arising from internal variability (Cox and Stephenson, 2007; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009). An additional source of projection uncertainty arises from possible future volcanic eruptions and future solar variability. Assessment of uncertainty relies on multi-model ensembles such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6, Eyring et al., 2016), single-model initial-condition large ensembles (e.g., Kay et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2020), and ensembles initialized from the observed climate state (decadal predictions, e.g., Smith et al., 2013a; Meehl et al., 2014; Boer et al., 2016; Marotzke et al., 2016). Ensemble evaluation methods include assessment of model performance and independence (e.g., Knutti et al., 2017; Boé, 2018; Abramowitz et al., 2019); emergent and other observational constraints (e.g., Allen and Ingram, 2002; Hall and Qu, 2006; Cox et al., 2018); and the uncertainty assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response in Chapter 7. Ensemble evaluation is assessed in Box 4.1 through the inclusion of lines of evidence in addition to the projection ensembles, including implications for potential model weighting.The uncertainty assessment in this chapter builds on one particularly noteworthy advance since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Internal variability, which constitutes irreducible uncertainty over much of the time horizon considered here (Hawkins et al., 2016; Marotzke, 2019), can be better estimated in models even under a changing climate through the use of large initial-condition ensembles (Kay et al., 2015). For many climate quantities and compared to the forced climate change signal, internal variability is dominant in any individual realization – including the one that will unfold in reality – in the near term (Kirtman et al., 2013; Marotzke and Forster, 2015), is substantial in the mid-term, and is still recognizable in the long term in many quantities (Deser et al., 2012a; Marotzke and Forster, 2015). This chapter will use the strengthened information on internal variability throughout.The expanded treatment of uncertainty allows this chapter a more comprehensive assessment of the benefits from mitigation than in previous IPCC reports, as well as the climate response to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation modification (SRM), and how to detect them against the backdrop of internal variability. Important advances have been made in the detection and attribution of mitigation, CDR, and SRM (Bürger and Cubasch, 2015; Lo et al., 2016; Ciavarella et al., 2017); exploring the ‘time of emergence’ (ToE; see Annex VII: Glossary) of responses to assumed emissions reductions (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 2013; Samset et al., 2020)and the attribution of decadal events to forcing changes that reflect emissions reductions (Marotzke, 2019; Spring et al., 2020; McKenna et al., 2021).The question of the potential crossing of thresholds relative to global temperature goals (Geden and Loeschel, 2017) is intimately related to the benefits of mitigation; a prerequisite is an assessment of how robustly magnitudes of warming can be defined (Millar et al., 2017). This chapter provides an update to the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5, IPCC, 2018a) and constitutes a reference point for later chapters and AR6 WGIII on the effects of mitigation, including a robust uncertainty assessment.The chapter is organized as follows (Figure 4.1). After (Section 4.2 on the methodologies used in the assessment, Section 4.3 assesses projected changes in key global climate indicators throughout the 21st century, relative to the period 1995–2014, which comprises the last 20 years of the historical simulations of CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and hence the most recent past simulated with the observed atmospheric composition. The global climate indicators assessed include GSAT, global land precipitation, Arctic sea ice area (SIA), global mean sea level (GMSL), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), global mean ocean surface pH, carbon uptake by land and ocean, the global monsoon, the Northern and Southern Annular Modes (NAM and SAM), and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Differently from the assessment for changes in other quantities only based on the range of CMIP6 projections, additional lines of evidence enter the assessment for GSAT and GMSL change. For most results and figures based on CMIP6, one realization from each model (the first of the uploaded set) is used. Section 4.3 finally synthesizes the assessment of GSAT change using multiple lines of evidence in addition to the CMIP6 projection simulations.Figure  4.1 | Visual guide to Chapter 4. (Section 4.4 covers near-term climate change, defined here as the period 2021–2040 and taken relative to the period 1995–2014. Section 4.4 focuses on global and large-scale climate indicators, including precipitation and circulation indices and selected modes of variability (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and Annex IV: Modes of Variability), as well as on the spatial distribution of warming. The potential roles of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and volcanic eruptions on near-term climate change are also discussed. Section 4.4 synthesizes information from initialized predictions and non-initialized projections for the near-term change.(Section 4.5 then covers mid-term and long-term climate change, defined here as the periods 2041–2060 and 2081–2100, respectively, again relative to the period 1995–2014. The mid-term period is thus chosen as the twenty-year period following the short-term period and straddling the mid-century point, year 2050; it is during the mid-term that differences between scenarios are expected to emerge against internal variability. The long-term period is defined, as in AR5, as the 20-year period at the end of the century. Section 4.5 assesses the same set of indicators as (Section 4.4, as well as changes in internal variability and in large-scale patterns, both of which are expected to emerge in the mid- to long-term. The chapter sub-division according to time slices (near term, mid-term, and long term) is thus to a large extent motivated by the different roles that internal variability plays in each period, compared to the expected forced climate-change signal.(Section 4.6 assesses the climate implications of climate policies, as simulated with climate models. First, Section 4.6 assesses patterns of climate change expected for various levels of GSAT rise including 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C, compared to the approximation to the pre-industrial period 1850–1900 to facilitate immediate connection to SR1.5 and the temperature goals specified in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2016). Section 4.6 continues with climate goals, overshoot, and path-dependence, as well as the climate response to mitigation, CDR, and SRM. Section 4.6 also covers the consistency between RCPs and SSPs.(Section 4.7 assesses very long-term changes in selected global climate indicators, from 2100 to 2300. Section 4.7 continues with climate-change commitment and the potential for irreversibility and abrupt climate change. The chapter concludes with Section 4.8 on the potential for low-likelihood, high-impact storylines, followed by answers to three frequently asked questions (FAQs).4.2 Methodology4.2.1 Models, Model Intercomparison Projects, and Ensemble Methodologies Similar to the approach used in AR5 (Flato et al., 2013), the primary lines of evidence of this chapter are comprehensive climate models (atmosphere–ocean general circulation models, AOGCMs) and Earth system models (ESMs); ESMs differ from AOGCMs by including representations of various biogeochemical cycles. We also build on results from ESMs of intermediate complexity (EMICs; Claussen et al., 2002; Eby et al., 2013) and other types of models where appropriate. This chapter focuses on a particular set of coordinated multi-model experiments known as model intercomparison projects (MIPs). These frameworks recommend and document standards for experimental design for running AOGCMs and ESMs to minimize the chance of differences in results being misinterpreted. CMIP is an activity of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the latest phase is CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016). To establish robustness of results, it is vital to assess the performance of these models in terms of mean state, variability, and the response to external forcings. That evaluation has been undertaken using the CMIP6 ‘Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima’ (DECK) and historical simulations in Chapter 3 of this Report, which concludes that there is  high confidence that the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well (Section 3.8.3.1).This chapter draws mainly on future projections referenced both against the period 1850–1900 and the recent past, 1995–2014, performed primarily under ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016). This allows us to assess both dimensions of integration across scenarios (Section 4.3) and global warming levels (Section 4.6) as discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.6). Other MIPs also target future scenarios with a focus on specific processes or feedbacks and are summarized in Table 4.1.Table 4.1 | Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) utilized in Chapter 4.

(2012)Multi-model ensembles provide the central focus of projection assessment. While single-model experiments have great value for exploring new results and theories, multi-model ensembles additionally underpin the assessment of the robustness, reproducibility, and uncertainty attributable to model internal structure and processes variability (Section 4.2.5; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009). Techniques underlying the combination of evaluation and weighting that are applied in this chapter are synthesized in Box 4.1.Climate model simulations can be performed in either ‘concentration-driven’ or ‘emissions-driven’ configurations reflecting whether the CO2 concentration is prescribed to follow a pre-defined pathway or is simulated by the Earth system models in response to prescribed emissions of CO2 (Box 6.4, Ciais et al., 2013). The majority of CMIP6 experiments are conducted in concentration-driven configurations in order to enable models without a fully interactive carbon cycle to perform them, and throughout most of this chapter we present results from those simulations unless otherwise stated. Concentrations of other greenhouse gases are always prescribed. However, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has also been performed in emissions-driven configuration (‘esm-ssp585’) by 10 ESMs, and in Section 4.3.1.1 we assess the impact on simulated climate over the 21st century.Internal variability complicates the identification of forced climate signals, especially when considering regional climate signals over short time scales (up to a few decades), such as local trends over the satellite era (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Deser et al., 2012a; Xie et al., 2015; Lovenduski et al., 2016; Suárez-Gutiérrez et al., 2017). Large initial-condition ensembles, where the same model is run repeatedly under identical forcing but with initial conditions varied through small perturbations or by sampling different times of a pre-industrial control run, have substantially grown in their use since AR5 (Deser et al., 2012a; Kay et al., 2015; Rodgers et al., 2015; Hedemann et al., 2017; Stolpe et al., 2018; Maher et al., 2019). Such large ensembles have shown potential to quantify uncertainty due to internal variability (Hawkins et al., 2016; McCusker et al., 2016; Sigmond and Fyfe, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; McKinnon et al., 2017; Marotzke, 2019) and thereby extract the forced signal from the internal variability, which can be calibrated against observational data to improve the reliability of probabilistic climate projections over the near and mid-term (O’Reilly et al., 2020). Moreover, they allow the investigation of forced changes in internal variability (e.g., Maher et al., 2018). A key assumption is that a given model skilfully represents internal variability; structural uncertainty is not accounted for.A complementary approach that represents structural uncertainty in a given model is stochastic physics (Berner et al., 2017). The approach has proven useful in representing structural uncertainty on seasonal climate time scales (Weisheimer et al., 2014; Batté and Doblas-Reyes, 2015; MacLachlan et al., 2015). Stochastic physics can markedly improve the internal variability in a given model (Dawson and Palmer, 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Christensen et al., 2017; Davini et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2017; Strømmen et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019). Stochastic physics can also correct long-standing mean-state biases (Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016) and can influence the predicted climate sensitivity (Christensen and Berner, 2019; Strommen et al., 2019; Meccia et al., 2020).Perturbed-physics ensembles (Murphy et al., 2004) are also used to systematically account for parameter uncertainty in a given model. Uncertain model parameters are identified and ranges in their values selected that conform to emergent observational constraints (see Section 1.5.4.2). These parameters are then changed between ensemble members to sample the effect of parameter uncertainty on climate (Piani et al., 2005; Sexton et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2018; Regayre et al., 2018). It is possible to weight ensemble members according to some performance metric or emergent constraint (e.g., Fasullo et al., 2015; Section 1.5.4.7) to improve the ensemble distribution (Box 4.1).4.2.2 ScenariosThe AR5 drew heavily on four main scenarios, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs: Meinshausen et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2011), and simulation results from CMIP5 (Section 4.2.1; Taylor et al., 2012). The RCPs were labelled by the approximate radiative forcing reached at the year 2100, going from 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 to 8.5 W m–2.This chapter draws on model simulations from CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) using a new range of scenarios based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs; O’Neill et al., 2016). The set of SSPs is described in detail in Chapter 1 (Section 1.6) and recognizes that global radiative forcing levels can be achieved by different pathways of CO2, non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols (Amann et al., 2013; Rao et al., 2017) and land use; the set of SSPs therefore establishes a matrix of global forcing levels and socio-economic storylines. ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016) identifies four priority (tier-1) scenarios that participating modelling groups are asked to perform, SSP1-2.6 for sustainable pathways, SSP2-4.5 for middle-of-the-road, SSP3-7.0 for regional rivalry, and SSP5-8.5 for fossil fuel-rich development. This chapter focuses its assessment on these, plus the SSP1-1.9 scenario, which is directly relevant to the assessment of the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal. Further, this chapter discusses these scenarios and their extensions past 2100 in the context of the very long-term climate change in Section 4.7.1. Projections of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are assessed in more detail in Chapter 6 (Section 6.7).In presenting results and evidence, this chapter tries to be as comprehensive as possible. In tables we show multi-model mean change and 5–95% range for all five SSPs, while in time series figures we show multi-model mean change for all five SSPs but for clarity 5–95% range only for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Where maps are presented, due to space restrictions we focus on showing multi-model mean change for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. SSP1-2.6 is preferred over SSP1-1.9 because the latter has far fewer simulations available. The high-end scenarios RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 have recently been argued to be implausible to unfold (e.g., Hausfather and Peters, 2020; see Chapter 3 of the AR6 WGIII). However, where relevant we show results for SSP5-8.5, for example to enable backwards compatibility with AR5, for comparison between emissions-driven and concentration-driven simulations, and because there is greater data availability of daily output for SSP5-8.5. When presenting low-likelihood, high-warming storylines we also show results from the high-end SSP5-8.5 scenario.ScenarioMIP simulations include advances in techniques to better harmonize with historical forcings relative to CMIP5. For example, projected changes in the solar cycle include long-term modulation rather than a repeating solar cycle (Matthes et al., 2017). Background natural aerosols are ramped down to an average historical level used in the control simulation by 2025 and background volcanic forcing is ramped up from the value at the end of the historical simulation period (2015) over 10 years to the same constant value prescribed for the pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations in the DECK, and then kept fixed – both changes are intended to avoid inconsistent model treatment of unknowable natural forcing to affect the near-term projected warming.Complete backward comparability between CMIP5 and CMIP6 scenarios cannot be established for detailed regional assessments, because the SSP scenarios include regional forcings – especially from land use and aerosols – that are different from the CMIP5 RCPs. Even at a global level, a quantitative comparison is challenging between corresponding SSP and RCP radiative forcing levels due to differing contributions to the forcing (Meinshausen et al., 2020) and evidence of differing model responses (Section 4.6.2.2; Wyser et al., 2020). The RCP scenarios assessed in AR5 all showed similar, rapid reductions in SLCFs and emissions of SLCF precursor species over the 21st century; the CMIP5 projections hence did not sample a wide range of possible trajectories for future SLCFs (Chuwah et al., 2013). The SSP scenarios assessed in the AR6 offer more scope to explore SLCF pathways as they sample a broader range of air quality policy options (Gidden et al., 2019) and relationships of CO2 to non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Meinshausen et al., 2020). Section 4.6.2.2 assesses RCP and SSP differences. Other MIPs (see Section 4.2.1) have been designed to explicitly explore some of the implications of the different socio-economic storylines for a given radiative forcing level.4.2.3 Sources of Near-term InformationThis subsection describes the three main sources of near-term information used in Chapter 4. These are (i) the projections from the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble introduced in Section 4.2.1 (Eyring et al., 2016; O’Neill et al., 2016); (ii) observationally constrained projections (Gillett et al., 2013; Stott et al., 2013); and (iii) the initialized predictions contributed to CMIP6 from the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP; Boer et al., 2016). The projections under (i) and the observational constraints under (ii) are used for all time horizons considered in this chapter, whereas the initialized predictions under (iii) are relevant only in the near term.Observationally constrained projections (Gillett et al., 2013, 2021; Shiogama et al., 2016; Ribes et al., 2021) use detection and attribution methods to attempt to reach consistency between observations and models and thus provide improved projections of near-term change. Notable advances have been made since AR5, for example the ability to observationally constrain estimates of Arctic sea ice loss for global warming of 1.5°C, 2.0°C, and 3.0°C above pre-industrial levels (Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Screen, 2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). There is  high confidence that these approaches can reduce the uncertainties involved in such estimates.The AR5 was the first IPCC report to assess decadal climate predictions initialized from the observed climate state (Kirtman et al., 2013), and assessed with  high confidence that these predictions exhibit positive skill for near-term average surface temperature information, globally and over large regions, for up to ten years. Substantially more experience in producing initialized decadal predictions has been gained since AR5; the remainder of this subsection assesses the advances made.Because the ‘memory’ that potentially enables prediction of multi-year to decadal internal variability resides mainly in the ocean, some systems initialize the ocean state only (e.g., Müller et al., 2012; Yeager et al., 2018), whereas others incorporate observed information in the initial atmospheric states (e.g., Pohlmann et al., 2013; Knight et al., 2014) or other non-oceanic drivers that provide further sources of predictability (Alessandri et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2014; Bellucci et al., 2015a).Ocean initialization techniques generally use one of two strategies. Under full-field initialization, estimates of observed climate states are represented directly on the model grid. A potential drawback is that predictions initialized using the full-field approach tend to drift toward the biased climate preferred by the model (Smith et al., 2013a; Bellucci et al., 2015b; Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016; Kröger et al., 2018; Nadiga et al., 2019). Such drifts can be as large as, or larger than, the climate anomaly being predicted and may therefore obscure predicted climate anomalies (Kröger et al., 2018) unless corrected for through post-processing. By contrast, anomaly initialization reduces drifts by adding observed anomalies (i.e., deviations from mean climate) to the mean model climate (Pohlmann et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013a; Thoma et al., 2015b; Cassou et al., 2018), but has the disadvantage that the model state is then further from the real world from the start of the prediction. For both approaches, unrealistic features in the observation data used for initialization may induce unrealistic transient behavior (Pohlmann et al., 2017; Teng et al., 2017; Nadiga et al., 2019), and non-linearity can reduce forecast skill (Chikamoto et al., 2019). As yet, neither of the initialization strategies has been clearly shown to be superior (Hazeleger et al., 2013; Magnusson et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013a; Marotzke et al., 2016), although such comparisons may be sensitive to the model, region, and details of the initialization and forecast assessment procedures considered (Polkova et al., 2014; Bellucci et al., 2015b).There is also a wide range of techniques employed to assimilate observed information into models in order to generate suitable initial conditions (Polkova et al., 2019). These range in complexity from simple relaxation towards observed time series of sea surface temperature (SST) (Mignot et al., 2016) or wind stress anomalies (Thoma et al., 2015a, b), to relaxation toward three-dimensional ocean and sometimes atmospheric state estimates from various sources (e.g., Pohlmann et al., 2013; Knight et al., 2014; Dunstone et al., 2016), or hybrid relaxation combining surface and tri-dimensional restoring as function of ocean basins and depth (Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016), to sophisticated data assimilation methods such as the ensemble Kalman filter (Nadiga et al., 2013; Counillon et al., 2014, 2016; Msadek et al., 2014; Karspeck et al., 2015; Brune et al., 2018; Cassou et al., 2018; Polkova et al., 2019), the four-dimensional ensemble-variational hybrid data assimilation (He et al., 2017, 2020) and the initialization of sea ice (Guemas et al., 2016; Kimmritz et al., 2018). In addition, decadal predictions necessarily consist of ensembles of forecasts to quantify uncertainty, as discussed in Section 4.2.1. A common way to generate an ensemble is through sets of initial conditions containing small variations that lead to different subsequent climate trajectories. A variety of methods and assumptions has been employed to generate and filter initial-condition ensembles for decadal prediction (e.g., Marini et al., 2016; Kadow et al., 2017). As yet, there is no clear consensus as to which initialization and ensemble generation techniques are most effective, and evaluations of their comparative performance within a single modelling framework are needed (Cassou et al., 2018).A consequence of model imperfections and resulting model systematic errors is that estimates of these errors must be removed from the prediction to isolate the predicted climate anomaly and the phase of the decadal modes of climate variability (Sections 4.4.3.5 and 4.4.3.6, and Annex IV, Sections AIV.2.6 and AIV.2.7). Because of the tendency for systematic drifts to occur following initialization, bias corrections generally depend on time since the start of the forecast, often referred to as lead time. In practice, the lead-time-dependent biases are calculated using ensemble retrospective predictions, also known as hindcasts, and recommended basic procedures for such corrections are provided in previous studies (Goddard et al., 2013; Boer et al., 2016). The biases are also dynamically corrected during hindcasts and predictions by incorporating the multi-year monthly mean analysis increments from the initialization into the initial condition at each integration step (Wang et al., 2013b). Besides mean climate as a function of lead time, further aspects of decadal predictions may be biased, such as the modes of variability (see Section 3.7 and Annex IV) upon which drift patterns are projected (Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016), and additional correction procedures have thus been proposed to remove biases in representing long-term trends (Kharin et al., 2012; Kruschke et al., 2016; Balaji et al., 2018; Pasternack et al., 2018), as well as more general dependences of drift on initial conditions (Fučkar et al., 2014; Pasternack et al., 2018; Nadiga et al., 2019).Many skill measures exist that describe different aspects of the correspondence between predicted and observed conditions, and no single metric should be considered exclusively. Important aspects of forecast performance captured by different skill measures include: (i) the ability to predict the sign and phases of the main modes of decadal variability and their regional fingerprint through teleconnections; (ii) the typical magnitude of differences between predicted and observed values, forecast reliability and resolution (Corti et al., 2012); and (iii) whether the forecast ensemble appropriately represents uncertainty in the predictions. A framework for skill assessment that encompasses each of these aspects of forecast quality has been proposed (Goddard et al., 2013). A new, process-based method to assess forecast skill in decadal predictions is to analyse how well a specific mechanism is represented at each lead time (Mohino et al., 2016).One additional aspect of forecast quality assessment is that estimated skill can be degraded by errors in observational datasets used for verification, in addition to errors in the predictions (Massonnet et al., 2016; Ferro, 2017; Karspeck et al., 2017; Juricke et al., 2018). This suggests that skill may tend to be underestimated, particularly for climate variables whose observational uncertainties are relatively large, and that the predictions themselves may prove useful for assessing the quality of observational datasets (Massonnet, 2019).Skill assessmentshave shown that initialized predictions can out-perform their uninitialized counterparts (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Meehl et al., 2014; Bellucci et al., 2015a; D.M. Smith et al., 2018, 2019; Yeager et al., 2018), although such comparisons are sensitive to the region and variable considered, multi-model predictions are generally more skilful than individual models (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; D.M. Smith et al., 2013b, 2019). Considerable skill, especially for temperature, can be attributed to external forcings such as changes in GHG, aerosol concentrations, and volcanic eruptions. On a global scale, this contribution to skill has been found to exceed that from the prediction of internal variability except in the early stages (about one year for global SST) of the forecast (Corti et al., 2015; Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020; Bilbao et al., 2021), though idealized potential skill measures and observations-based studies suggest that improving the prediction of internal variability could extend this crossover to longer lead times (Boer et al., 2013; Årthun et al., 2017). In some cases, part of the skill arises from the ability of initialized predictions to capture observed transitions of major modes of climate variability (Meehl et al., 2016) such as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV; see Sections 4.4.3.5 and 4.4.3.6, and Annex IV, Sections AIV.2.6 and AIV.2.7).Initialized predictions of near-surface temperature are particularly skilful over the North Atlantic, a region of high potential and realized predictability (Keenlyside et al., 2008; Pohlmann et al., 2009; Boer et al., 2013; Yeager and Robson, 2017). Much of this predictability is associated with the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (Wouters et al., 2013), where skill in predicting ocean conditions is typically high (Hazeleger et al., 2013; Brune and Baehr, 2020) and shifts in ocean temperature and salinity potentially affecting surface climate can be predicted up to several years in advance (Robson et al., 2012; Hermanson et al., 2014), although such assessments remain challenging due to incomplete knowledge of the state of the ocean during the hindcast evaluation periods (Menary and Hermanson, 2018). A substantial improvement of the sub-polar gyre SST prediction is found in CMIP6 models, which is attributed to a more accurate response to the AMOC-related delayed response to volcanic eruptions (Section 4.4.3; Borchert et al., 2021). A significant improvement GSAT prediction skill is also found over some land regions including East Asia (Monerie et al., 2018), Eurasia (Wu et al., 2019), Europe (Müller et al., 2012; D.M. Smith et al., 2019) and the Middle East (D.M. Smith et al., 2019).Skill for multi-year to decadal precipitation forecasts is generally much lower than for temperature, although one exception is Sahel rainfall (Sheen et al., 2017), due to its dependence on predictable variations in North Atlantic SST through teleconnections (Annex IV; Martin and Thorncroft, 2014a). Predictive skill on decadal time scales is found for extratropical storm-tracks and storm density (Kruschke et al., 2016; Schuster et al., 2019), atmospheric blocking (Schuster et al., 2019; Athanasiadis et al., 2020), the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO; Scaife et al., 2014; Pohlmann et al., 2019) and over the tropical oceans (tropical trans-basin variability; Chikamoto et al., 2015). In addition, decadal predictions with large ensemble sizes are able to predict multi-annual temperature (Peters et al., 2011; Sienz et al., 2016; Borchert et al., 2019; Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020), precipitation (Yeager et al., 2018; D.M. Smith et al., 2019), and atmospheric circulation (Smith et al., 2020) anomalies over certain land regions, although the ensemble-mean magnitudes are much weaker than observed. This discrepancy may be symptomatic of an apparent deficiency in climate models that causes some predictable signal, such as that associated to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Section AIV.2.1), to be much weaker than in nature (Eade et al., 2014; Scaife and Smith, 2018; Strommen and Palmer, 2019; Smith et al., 2020), while others, such as that linked to the SAM (Section AIV.2.2), are more consistent with observations (Byrne et al., 2019).Evidence is accumulating that additional properties of the Earth system relating to ocean variability may be skilfully predicted on multi-annual time scales. These include levels of Atlantic hurricane activity (Smith et al., 2010; Caron et al., 2017), winter sea ice in the Arctic (Onarheim et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2020), drought and wildfire (Chikamoto et al., 2017; Paxian et al., 2019; Solaraju-Murali et al., 2019), and variations in the ocean carbon cycle including CO2 uptake (H. Li et al., 2016, 2019; Lovenduski et al., 2019; Fransner et al., 2020) and chlorophyll (Park et al., 2019).In summary, despite challenges (Cassou et al., 2018), there is  high confidence that initialized predictions contribute information to near-term climate change for some regions over multi-annual to decadal time scales. Furthermore, there are indications that initialized predictions can constrain near-term projections (Befort et al., 2020). The clearest improvements through initialization are seen in the North Atlantic and related phenomena such as hurricane frequency, Sahel and European rainfall. By contrast, there is mediumor low confidence that uncertainty is reduced for other climate variables.4.2.4 Pattern ScalingProjected climate change is typically represented in this chapter for specific future periods. One important source of uncertainty in projections presented for fixed future epochs (time-slabs/time-slices) is the underlying scenario used; another is the structural uncertainty associated with model climate sensitivity. Presenting projections and associated measures of uncertainty for specific periods (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5) remains the most widely applied methodology towards informing climate change impact studies. It is becoming increasingly important from the perspective of climate change and mitigation policy, however, to present projections also as a function of the change in global mean temperature (i.e., global warming levels, GWLs). They are expressed either in terms of changes of global mean surface temperature (GMST) or GSAT (see Section 1.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). For example, the IPCC SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) assessed the regional patterns of warming and precipitation change for GMST increase of 1.5°C and 2°C above 1850–1900 levels. Techniques used to represent the spatial variations in climate at a given GWL are referred to as pattern scaling.In the ‘traditional’ methodology as applied in AR5 (Collins et al., 2013), patterns of climate change in space are calculated as the product of the change in GSAT at a given point in time and a spatial pattern of change that is constant over time and the scenario under consideration, and which may or may not depend on a particular climate model (Allen and Ingram, 2002; Mitchell, 2003; Lambert and Allen, 2009; Andrews and Forster, 2010; Bony et al., 2013; Lopez et al., 2014). This approach assumes that external forcing does not affect the internal variability of the climate system, which may be regarded a stringent assumption when taking into account decadal and multi-decadal variability (Lopez et al., 2014) and the potential non-linearity of the climate change signal. Moreover, pattern scaling is expected to have lower skill for variables with large spatial variability (Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014). Pattern scaling also fails to capture changes in boundaries that move poleward such as sea ice extent and snow cover (Collins et al., 2013), and temporal frequency quantities such as frost days that decrease under warming but are bounded at zero. Spatial patterns are also expected to be different between transient and equilibrium simulations because of the long adjustment time scale of the deep ocean.Further developments of the AR5 approach have since explored the role of aerosols in modifying regional climate responses at a specific degree of global warming and also the effect of different GCMs and scenarios on the scaled spatial patterns (Frieler et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2013). Furthermore, the modified forcing-response framework (Kamae and Watanabe, 2012, 2013; Sherwood et al., 2015), which decomposes the total climate change into fast adjustments and slow response, identifies the fast adjustment as forcing-dependent and the slow response as forcing-independent, scaling with the change in GSAT.For precipitation change, there is near-zero fast adjustment for solar forcing but suppression during the fast-adjustment phase for CO2 and black-carbon radiative forcing (Andrews et al., 2009; Bala et al., 2010; Cao et al., 2015). By contrast, the slow response in precipitation change is independent of the forcing. This indicates that pattern scaling is not expected to work well for climate variables that have a large fast-adjustment component. Even in such cases, pattern scaling still works for the slow response component, but a correction for the forcing-dependent fast adjustment would be necessary to apply pattern scaling to the total climate change signal. In a multi-model setting, it has been shown that temperature change patterns conform better to pattern scaling approximation than precipitation patterns (Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014).Herger et al. (2015) have explored the use of multiple predictors for the spatial pattern of change at a given degree of global warming, following the approach of Joshi et al. (2013) that explored the role of the land–sea warming ratio as a second predictor. They found that the land–sea warming contrast changes in a non-linear way with GSAT, and that it approximates the role of the rate of global warming in determining regional patterns of climate change. The inclusion of the land–sea warming contrast as the second predictor provides the largest improvement over the traditional technique. However, as pointed out by Herger et al. (2015), multiple-predictor approaches still cannot detect non-linearities (or internal variability), such as the apparent dependence of spatial temperature variability in the mid- to high latitudes on GSAT (e.g., Fischer and Knutti, 2014; Screen, 2014).An alternative to the traditional pattern scaling approach is the time-shift method described by Herger et al. (2015) which is applied in this chapter (also called the epoch approach; see Section 4.6.1). When applied to a transient scenario such as SSP5-8.5, a future time-slab is referenced to a particular increase in the GSAT (e.g., 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels). The spatial patterns that result represent a direct scaling of the spatial variations of climate change at the particular level of global warming. An important advantage of this approach is that it ensures physical consistency between the different variables for which changes are presented (Herger et al., 2015). The internal variability does not have to be scaled and is consistent with the GSAT change. Furthermore, the time-shift method allows for a partial comparison of how the rate of increase in GSAT influences the regional spatial patterns of climate change. For example, spatial patterns of change for global warming of 2°C can be compared across the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Direct comparisons can also be obtained between variations in the regional impacts of climate change for the case where global warming stabilizes at, for instance, 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, as opposed to the case where the GSAT reaches and then exceeds the 1.5°C or 2°C thresholds (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018). An important potential caveat is that forcing mechanisms such as aerosol radiative forcing are represented differently in different models, even for the same SSP. This may imply different regional aerosol direct and indirect effects, implying different regional climate change patterns. Hence, it is important to consider the variations in the forcing mechanisms responsible for a specific increase in GSAT towards understanding the uncertainty range associated with the variations in regional climate change. A minor practical limitation of this approach is that stabilization scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, such as SSP1-2.6, do not allow for spatial patterns of change to be calculated from these scenarios at higher levels of global warming, while it is possible in scenarios such as SSP5-8.5 (Herger et al., 2015).In this chapter, the spatial patterns of change as a function of GWLs (defined in terms of the increase in the GSAT relative to 1850–1900) are thus constructed using the time-shift approach, thereby accounting for various non-linearities and internal variability that influence the projected climate change signal. This implies a reliance on large ensemble sizes to quantify the role of uncertainties in regional responses to different degrees of global warming. The assessment in Section 4.6.1 also explores how the rate of global warming (as represented by different SSPs), aerosol effects, and transient as opposed to stabilization scenarios influence the spatial variations in climate change at specific levels of global warming.4.2.5 Quantifying Various Sources of UncertaintyThe AR5 assessed with very high confidence that climate models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period, including the more rapid warming in the second half of the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions. Furthermore, because climate and Earth system models are based on physical principles, they were assessed in AR5 to reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. Both aspects were argued to contribute to our confidence in the models’ suitability for their application in quantitative future predictions and projections (Flato et al., 2013). This Report assesses (in Section 3.8.2) with  high confidence that for most large-scale indicators of climate change, the recent mean climate simulated by the latest generation climate models underpinning this assessment has improved compared to the models assessed in AR5, and with  high confidence that the multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well. These assessments form the foundation of applying climate and Earth system models to the projections assessed in this chapter. Where appropriate, the assessment of projected changes is accompanied by an assessment of process understanding and model evaluation.That said, fitness-for-purpose of the climate models used for long-term projections is fundamentally difficult to ascertain and remains an epistemological challenge (Parker, 2009; Frisch, 2015; Baumberger et al., 2017). Some literature exists comparing previous IPCC projections to what has unfolded over the subsequent decades (Cubasch et al., 2013), and recent work has confirmed that climate models since around 1970 have projected global surface warming in reasonable agreement with observations once the difference between assumed and actual forcing has been taken into account (Hausfather et al., 2020). However, the long-term perspective to the end of the 21st century or even out to 2300 takes us beyond what can be observed in time for a standard evaluation of model projections, and in this sense the assessment of long-term projections will remain fundamentally limited.The spread across individual runs within a multi-model ensemble represents the response to a combination of different sources of uncertainties (Section 1.4.3), specifically: scenario uncertainties, climate response uncertainties (also referred to as model uncertainties) related to parametric and other structural uncertainties in the model representation of the climate system, and internal variability (e.g., Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Kirtman et al., 2013). While the nature of these uncertainties was introduced in Section 1.4.3, this subsection assesses methods to disentangle different sources of uncertainties and quantify their contributions to the overall ensemble spread.As discussed extensively in AR5 (Collins et al., 2013), ensemble spread in projections performed with different climate models accounts for only part of the entire model uncertainty, even when considering the uncertainty in the radiative forcing in projections (Vial et al., 2013) and forced response. The AR5 uncertainty characterisation (Kirtman et al., 2013) followed Hawkins and Sutton (2009) and diagnosed internal variability through a high-pass temporal filter. This approach has deficiencies particularly if internal variability manifests on the multi-decadal time scales (Deser et al., 2012a; Marotzke and Forster, 2015) and is classified as (model) response uncertainty instead of internal variability. Single-model initial-condition large ensembles revealed that the AR5 approach underestimates the role of internal variability uncertainty and overestimates the role of model uncertainty (Maher et al., 2018; Stolpe et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2020) particularly at the local scale while yielding a reasonable approximation for uncertainty separation for GSAT (Lehner et al., 2020).Single-model initial-condition large ensembles thus represent a crucial step towards a cleaner separation of model uncertainty and internal variability than available for AR5 (Deser et al., 2014, 2016; Saffioti et al., 2017; Sippel et al., 2019; Milinski et al., 2020; von Trentini et al., 2020; Maher et al., 2021). Novel approaches have been proposed to further quantify internal variability in multi-model ensembles (Hingray and Saïd, 2014; Evin et al., 2019; Hingray et al., 2019). For time horizons beyond the limit of decadal predictability (Branstator and Teng, 2010; Meehl et al., 2014; Marotzke et al., 2016), such as in the CMIP6 projections, the simulations are starting from random rather than assimilated initial conditions. Internal variability constitutes an uncertainty in the projection of the climate in a future period of 10 or 20 years that is irreducible, but can be precisely quantified for individual models using sufficiently large initial-condition ensembles (Fischer et al., 2013; Deser et al., 2016, 2020; Hawkins et al., 2016; Pendergrass et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2018; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; Maher et al., 2019).Uncertainties in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols that affect future radiative forcings are represented by selected SSP scenarios (Sections 1.6.1 and 4.2.2). In addition to emission uncertainties, SSPs represent uncertainties in land use changes (van Vuuren et al., 2011; Ciais et al., 2013; O’Neill et al., 2016; Christensen et al., 2018). Additional uncertainty comes from climate carbon-cycle feedbacks and the residence time of atmospheric constituents, and are at least partly accounted for in emissions-driven simulations as opposed to concentration-driven simulations (Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Hewitt et al., 2016). The climate carbon-cycle feedbacks affect the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE). Constraining this uncertainty is crucial for the assessment of remaining carbon budgets consistent with global mean temperature levels (Millar et al., 2017; IPCC, 2018a) and is covered in
