One problem we have is that because the climate has been so temperate and accommodating in the 
past, it is hard to imagine that the whole system could switch so dramatically to become such a 
dangerous enemy. Indeed, human beings have just experienced an unusually balanced and warm 
climatic period known as the ‘Holocene’ that lasted from 11,700 BCE until the modern day. This calm 
interglacial pocket of time provided the favourable conditions that helped Neolithic homo-sapiens to 
grow up and then served as the background for our more immediate ancestors’ development in the 
Bronze and Iron Ages.  
Science also enables us to look much further back over our shoulder further into the distance.  
Beyond the Holocene, the hominoids who lived in the last 800,000 years of the Palaeolithic Age, lived 
on an Earth with wider swings in the patterns of climate. From this wider perspective, we can see the 
effects of planet Earth’s slowly drifting patterns of orbits, spins and wobbles (more eloquently known 
as the Milankovitch cycles). These huge rhythmic pulses can be seen throughout this age, a regular 
beat that comes to an unusually long, warm pause in the Holocene. This background climate of this 
Pleistocene epoch is cooler and rougher, but it was the world that the primates evolved in and it had 
a firmly rooted pattern.  
What is shocking, is that we have exited both the cosy Holocene, and this settled long-term rhythm in 
a sudden and massive surge upwards. Through the burning of fossil fuels on a monumental scale
