PART TWO: Solutions 
The Climate Academy 
 
Introduction 
 
Education as we know it today can trace a line back to a modest corner of Athens.  
This place will be the location for this final chapter.  
As with the Piraeus, this area is not famous because of a landmark, monument or statue. There are 
no postcards to be found of it. A Google image search will not provide anything really recognizable. 
Any selfie taken there would require a lot of explanation. Today it is just a zone of Athens that is full 
of garages, workshops, warehouses, the odd residential building and a few patches of green.  
Yet we instantly recognize the name of this place.  
 
It is called Academia.
