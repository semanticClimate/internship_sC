systemic failure at the fundamental level of the environment, is more than just a detail. It undermines 
everything else.  
The difficult truth is that the climate crisis exists in a double-blind spot: Democracies are prone to look 
away from difficulties, and capitalist cultural memes about individual consumption and choices have 
flooded out our capacity to think beyond the self.   
This double-blind spot could be observed on the BBC, during the televised Tory leadership debate 
between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. There was only one question squeezed in about climate change; 
and it was shambolically, irresponsibly limp: “As Prime Minister, what three things should people 
change in their lives to tackle climate change faster?”.398  
So, no systemic view.  
No systemic responsibility. 
Just a gentle little nudge to people to maybe change a few little things in their consumptive lives. 
Ouch!
