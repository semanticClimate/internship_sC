To help get a mental map of the current gap between culture and reality, it is informative to look at 
the image below. This chart provides an approximate sketch of the situation that exists when the 
scientific knowledge and the media coverage are superimposed onto each other. 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The lines and curves that are drawn in this image270 are not based on a statistical study, but people 
familiar with climate change at a decent level will recognise its basic accuracy. In the chart, the 
“Most informed opinion” represents the science stated in the earlier chapters of this book. The 
reason for the spread of the informed opinion is that the climate system is so complex, and it is 
therefore very demanding to work out how quickly all the different mechanisms will interact, and on 
what timescale. Just to be clear, the word “catastrophe” refers to the collapse of ecological systems 
that human life depends on, and the “slight costs” would be the various natural disasters that have 
already killed millions of people and caused trillions of dollars of economic damage.   
Of course, the advantage of such a broad zoom here makes it implausible to connect the lines to a 
set of data or results. Yet despite all the numerous variables that lie behind this sketch of the 
predicted impacts, the overall image remains informative.  
A disjunction  
The ‘box’ that depicts the range of “debate in the popular press” has a technical name, it is known as 
“The Overton Window”. The media might touch upon some of the substantial impacts of climate 
change, but most commonly they are individual weather events that are tagged as “possibly” related 
to climate change by “some” scientists.
