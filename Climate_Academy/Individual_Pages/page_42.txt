Homo Sapiens?  
 
If the current slice of geological time needs a new label, maybe it is also time for us to rethink our 
own? Maybe homo sapiens is a bit of an overstatement? Our name literally means “wise human”. We 
got this official classification in 1758, a date that was right in the middle of “The Enlightenment”. It 
was a time when our capacity for reason and reasonableness was widely celebrated. We were making 
great progress in science, politics, and a wide spectrum of the Arts. It was not a surprise then that the 
Swedish scientist Carolus Linneaus thought so highly of us when he was working out his taxonomy of 
the natural world. The good vibes of the Enlightenment led him to put the sticky label, “homo sapiens” 
on our backs.  
However, overstepping so many planetary boundaries is arguably a good moment for a rethink. We 
could just suspend the label homo sapiens for the moment, until we have some proper control of 
emissions, resource extractions and biodiversity destruction. Given that the fundamental force behind 
all these problems is over consumption, maybe the best label for us is “promo sapiens”, in recognition 
of all the shopping we do. Or to match the disco ball of the Anthropocene, we should rename ourselves 
‘party animals’? And to keep things consistent with Linneaus’ Latin labels for all the other species, that 
then becomes ‘festivum animal’.     
 
The only problem with this new label is that it distorts the fact that only a small minority of humans 
are at the party causing all the disruption. But that is an issue for Chapter 6, “Who is responsible?”.
