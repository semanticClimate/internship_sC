economist Amartya Sen’s assertion that “no famine in the history of the world has ever occurred in a 
functioning democracy”.194  
 
 
 
Holding those responsible to account 
Sen raises a critical point. How functional is our democracy? How siloed, softened and silenced has it 
been by the direct and indirect forces of capitalism?  
In August of 1943, the editor of ‘The Statesman’, Ian Stephens, broke rank and published graphic 
images of the famine for the first time. The photographs dodged the problem of not being able to 
use the word famine, and the images of starving Bengalis on the streets of Calcutta grabbed the 
global headlines. The photographs then mobilized a rapid set of actions by the new Viceroy 
(Archibald Wavell) to prevent further losses. Stephens was rightly applauded by the Famine Inquiry 
Commission, and Bengalis widely consider his decision as "a singular act of journalistic courage 
without which many more lives would have surely been lost"195.  
The Climate Academy works in close collaboration with News Decoder, an independent organization 
committed to quality youth journalism skills and reporting. It is with their guidance that the 
following gallery of MAPA articles has been written. Young people need to be courageous and clear 
minded to hold those responsible to account. We need a whole new army of young talent to prevent 
us from “Amusing Ourselves to Death” (Neil Postman, 1983).
