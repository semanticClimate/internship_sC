The life of Socrates provides us with a vivid example of how to effectively engage in the civic space 
whilst in the middle of the climate crisis. He was a powerful role model for Plato, and he is a 
powerful role model for students of The Climate Academy.  
Socrates life was dedicated to the Athenian polis, and that dedication was simply about asking 
questions.  He was: 
a. willing to ask hard questions about what seemed to be common sense.   
b. willing to interrogate values 
c. willing to think and test things at a systems level  
d. willing to question those in power 
e. willing to test his own ideas and assumptions  
f. eager to talk to anyone and question anything 
 
Socrates famously visited the Delphic Oracle437 who informed him that he was “the wisest man in all 
of Athens”. At first, this confused Socrates, as he was acutely aware of his own limits. Then he 
understood. He was the wisest, precisely because he was the one who knew that he knew so little.  
This is the key to effective and potent civic engagement for Climate Academy students: informed 
modesty.  
Being a Climate Academy student  
 
437 The Delphic Oracle was a shrine, dedicated to the god Apollo, on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, Delphi. 
The High Priestess, Pythia, would provide prophetic statements to those who consulted her. Many prominent 
people of the ancient world consulted her, such as the King of Athens and the King of Lydia.
