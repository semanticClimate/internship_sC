Above is a graphic of the major cogs that determine life on planet Earth. They all exist and morph in 
an interconnected balance with each other. It could be called the ‘meta’ map of natural world. These 
cogs can be classified into groups. At the broadest scale, there are three.   
The planetary systems that relate to ice, such as the permafrost areas in the polar north and the 
massive ice sheets in the polar south, are known to science as the Cryosphere210211.   
There are also major biological systems: with components such as the vast Boreal Forests, Amazon 
Rainforest and tropical coral reefs.  
 
210 The Cryosphere also includes the world’s glaciers, such as the Himalayas and the Andes. Although they are 
minor cogs in terms of the interplay of planet Earth’s physical forces, they are absolutely critical to the 
livelihood of billions of humans who need fresh water to survive. The dangers posed by their rapid retreat does 
not need underlining.    
211 Over the long term mountain glaciers could only contribute 40cm of sea level rise and are therefore much 
less significant than the 120m* . However, because of their small size they respond much faster to changing 
conditions and are currently responsible for 25-30% of sea level rise – a third of which is from Alaska alone.
