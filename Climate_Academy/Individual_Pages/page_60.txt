To bring the acceleration of the warning signal more clearly into view. The next chart shows the 
shorter and shorter time that lies between each notch of 0.1°C up the global warming average 
temperature scale. Back in 1970s, when we had a full understanding of the problem it took 7.3 years 
to move from 0.2°C to 0.3°C warming above the pre-industrial average. Now our emissions are pushing 
us through those steps of temperature in just 3.1 years. To state the obvious, since we have had a full 
understanding about the mechanics of climate change and the need to reduce our emissions, we have 
only accelerated them. Indeed, we are now emitting at double the speed of the 1970s.
