What is rarely the centre of gravity for the coverage is the question that matters the most. Again: is 
the pledge enough?   
This zombie like response is utterly remarkable.  
One fundamental reason why this question is not asked, is because the media simply does not have 
any way to measure the true value of a new pledge. There is no reliable, standard index that is 
available to them which could be used to get a proper grip on how good the commitment actually is.  
This chapter is written to put the first step forward in fixing this glaring hole in our awareness.  
This chapter will provide that index.  
It is simply called the CUTx Index.
