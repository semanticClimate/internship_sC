For all of those millions of people who are deeply concerned about the climate crisis, where do they 
go to get a reliable update about the state we are in? We all want to hold our governments to 
account for their inaction, but how can that possibly be measured if there are no established norms 
for emissions? How do we defend human equality before the law if the law has no international and 
scientifically informed standard to plug into? How do we uphold universal human rights if we do not 
make our calculations of emissions on a per capita basis?  
 
Questions 
1. What different reasons can help explain the absence of a global index for climate change? 
2. How do nations declare the commitments to climate change?  
3. Where could this index be displayed in public?
