a) India - The Great Famine of 1876-78 
These background truths were pushed into the foreground during the famine of 1876-78.  
Following a drought in the Deccan Plateau, this famine covered an area of 670,000sq km. It held 
around 60 million people in its bony grip. It is known as “The Great Famine”… just like World War 
One was really “Great”.161 An estimated 5.6-9.6 million Indians died. Behind this dismal death toll, 
the partnership of profits and prejudice can be seen in operation. These two dominant features of 
the causes of the famine do not just work in parallel, they were intertwined, and even amplified 
each other.  
The Governor of the Bombay area at the time was Sir Richard Temple. He actually had experience, 
and a good track-record, of famine response in India. His performance was exemplary in the ‘The 
Bihar Famine’ just a few years before, in this crisis of 1873-74. When the lives of 21.5 million people 
in his province were threatened, Temple quickly organized the import of 450,000 tonnes of rice from 
neighbouring Burmese stocks162. His swift and efficient action meant that there were no deaths 
reported from the crisis.    
Yet.  
Two years later, when the Great Famine of 1876 started, he had a new boss: Lord Robert Bulwer-
Lytton. His boss knew how costly the purchase and transportation of food was; costs that are were 
inflated by the price spike that always precedes a famine (just as surely as disease follows like a dark 
shadow afterwards). Lytton insisted that "everything must be subordinated to the financial 
consideration of disbursing the smallest sum of money."163 There was therefore no attempt made to 
move stocks of food to the people who needed it. Worse, shockingly worse, during this moment of 
crisis, British exports of food from the region continued; such as 320,000 tonnes of wheat - shipped 
out to the UK.  
This ghastly juxtaposition of famine and food exports was not new.  
During the 1866 famine (noted at the start of this section), the British exported 100,000 tonnes of 
rice. Likewise, "During the famine of 1899–1900, when 143,000 Beraris died directly from starvation, 
the province exported not only thousands of bales of cotton but an incredible 747,000 bushels of 
 
161 WW1 counted 40 million casualties, and between 15-22 million dead.
