The Keeling Curve 
This kind of news should hit us deeply. Time should slow down a little as we read it. This is because 
the sheer gravity of some moments of news in our life are so profound that it is almost as if the 
universe flips into slow- mode, just to allow us the space to process each word. Just like those 
moments when a doctor spells out the diagnosis from a scan, when a lover responds to a proposal, 
or when a voice on the phone starts to give you feedback on a job interview. 
The climate is a very (very) big deal. 
But somehow, we are deaf to the warnings.  
It is really quite weird. 
 
The Trojan Horse 
Maybe the Greeks can help us frame what is going on?  
Greek epic literature could see with such probity into the human condition about our failings, it 
wouldn’t be a surprise to find out that they might have something powerful to say. Indeed. They 
didn’t just give us marvellous sculptures to look at and temples to admire; they didn’t just provide us 
with the remarkable breakthroughs in Philosophy, Mathematics, and the art of the feta cheese 
sandwich; they did not just gift us the world’s first university and democracy…  
The Greeks gifted to us the Trojan Horse.  
It was not only full of soldiers, it was also full of symbolic meaning.
