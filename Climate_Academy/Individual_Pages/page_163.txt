The Matrix (1999) 
 
 
 
Morpheus : Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something. 
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life, that there's 
something wrong with the world. You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in 
your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know 
what I'm talking about? 
Neo : The Matrix. 
Morpheus : Do you want to know what it is? 
Neo : Yes. 
Morpheus : The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You 
can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can 
feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the 
world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 
Neo : What truth? 
Morpheus : That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. 
Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind.
