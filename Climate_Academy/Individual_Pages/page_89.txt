CUT X INDEX 
 
But how can this be done?  
 
And to achieve it a simple, transparent measure 
of progress is needed. And the good news is that 
it is not complicated.  
 
The only reliable way to know if we are on track 
to stabilise emissions at a safe level is by tracking 
the level of the remaining carbon budget for 
1.5°C and 2°C. For this there is simple tool: the 
“CUTx Index”. This index takes the latest data on 
the carbon budget and divides it equally 
amongst all the people of the Earth. Grouped 
then into nations, it provides an X-ray image of the true situation. It shows precisely where we are 
up to, and who is undermining the stability of life on Earth.  
 
The next chapter will demonstrate that it is richest nations of the world who are filling the atmosphere 
with greenhouse gases at the most reckless rates. Chapter 6 will also explain the simple data and 
principles behind the index. There would be a case for calling it “The Common-Sense Index”. However, 
such a title would betray the fact that there is necessarily a scientific basis to the index - one that is 
rooted in the remaining carbon budget.  
Is it not truly odd that we have no reliable index for climate change? Is it not utterly bizarre that we 
have no standard measure of where we are up to? Why do we not attentively measure the gap 
between ourselves and an existential disaster?   
It is weirdly mesmerising that every year thousands of delegates, with thousands of scientists, 
accompanied by thousands of staff, tracked by thousands of reporters, all assemble in one town for 
two weeks … and yet the main reason for them all being there is not addressed with any clarity 
whatsoever.  
We currently have no dashboard for the greatest problem that has ever hung above our heads.  
At every United Nations COP, there are rooms just full of people who don’t look up.
