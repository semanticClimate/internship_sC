A brave heart – to challenge the school to explore much further 
How to Play 
Take the document, take your pen, and you are now ready for Climate Change Bingo! 
The game is simple. Every time you see or hear a word you may colour in the box – either on the 
“Greenwash” card or the “Deep Green” card.  
On the Greenwash card, you win a bio-apple for being the first to colour in the corners. You win an 
energy efficient light bulb for the first completed line. Fill in the whole grid, and you can put an Eco 
Friendly School certificate in the front window of your school and on your website.  
You probably won’t need the “Deep Green” card.

The irony of this little thought experiment is to be taken lightly – but the message a deadly serious 
one. Of course, every green impulse, every green engagement and plan has a value. It is normal that 
a school will start with a background ‘greenwash’ to establish a space for the next level of work. 
However, to simply stop at this most rudimentary background phrase is not OK. We must be brave 
enough to call it for what it is: utterly inadequate, without the fuller picture in place too.
