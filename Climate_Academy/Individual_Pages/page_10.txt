It looked like an unfinished children’s play area. It was just missing the ropes between the logs…  for 
those with the right level of enthusiasm to straddle their way from post to post. There was a plaque 
in front of the clearing. However, the plaque was not a health and safety notice from Durham 
council about the most appropriate ages for such a play area, warnings about depositing dog dung, 
or various legal disclaimers.  
It just stated, rather unexpectedly, “The Upper Room”.  
On closer inspection, walking around 
the bald trunks of those Dutch Elm 
trees, some surprising details became 
clear. On most of the trunks, far above 
eye level, someone had chiselled out 
segments of stone window arches. On a 
few, at knee height, someone had 
sculpted out a few pots. And on others, 
at waist height, there were shapes that 
looked like bits of plates and bowls.  
It was all a bit random.  
 
 
There was one wider upright timber with fewer detailed markings on it. This large trunk stood at one 
slightly narrower end of the formation. It had an inviting seat cut into it. So I accepted the invitation. 
 
Suddenly, I found myself in the middle of The Last Supper. Now, in 
front of me, the other 12 trees all lined up in my view and formed a 
startling wide-screen image. I was looking into a room where each 
tree and every detail had become part of a 3D, large scale jigsaw 
puzzle. The space had been transformed, and I was sat in “The Upper 
Room”.  
I had found the right seat.
