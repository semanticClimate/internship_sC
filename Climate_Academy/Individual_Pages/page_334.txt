The golden ratio in pinecones and pineapples. 420   
 
 
We can go even further. The golden ratio of the Fibonacci sequence can also be seen imprinting 
itself on human activity.  
Down the road in downtown Athens, the construction of the monumental Parthenon had been 
completed in 438BCE. It was built as a testimony to the Athenians’ victory over the Persians. It was 
also built in testimony to the beauty of mathematical principles.  
Anyone with a tape measure might not be impressed to find that the foundation stones measure 
69.5 meters by 30.9 meters, and that the columns of the temple measure 9.09 meters. However, a 
step backwards in perspective reveals that these proportions give the building a remarkable poise 
and energy. A further step backwards into the mathematics active in the minds of the architects 
reveals that the Temple was not just dedicated to Athena, but also to the magical qualities of the 
ratio of 1.618. 421  
Remarkably, the ratio could be found all over the body parts of the builders who chiselled away at 
those golden stones. It can even be found in their DNA. 422   
 
It would be truly bizarre if we lived in a universe in which the mathematical order of things had 
nothing to do with the natural order. How could there be a disconnect between the intelligible world 
and the material world? Maths and Physics have to be intimately related.

421 To be precise, φ (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618033988749894848204586834... 
422 The DNA molecule, the program for all life, is also based on the golden mean. It measures 34 angstroms 
long by 21 angstroms wide for each full cycle of its double helix spiral. 34 and 21, are numbers in the Fibonacci 
series and their ratio, 1.6190476 closely approximates phi, 1.6180339.
