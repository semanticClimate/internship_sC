As one final reminder. Here is the dashboard of where we are up to.  
 
 
The key details have been explained in the previous chapters, but here is a summary ‘radar’ 
image of the situation. The image comes from a research paper published by the prestigious 
Potsdam Institute.  It demonstrates that in 2023, six out of nine planetary boundaries had 
already been crossed, and that pressure in all 9 of them were increasing.438

budgets and the jargon of climate change policies.  
 
And, it is also critical to be numerate.  
 
The CUTx Index is a brilliant and simple measure of where we are up to. It empowers 
students to decode the most convoluted climate promises. It exposes so many false 
narratives. And because it is so simple, it allows revealing comparisons to be made between 
nations. It is a unique, authoritative tracker that enables students to see the boundaries of 
the crisis in the most direct way.  
 
Without these numbers, how can we ask the simple, informed question? How have we come 
so far into this crisis without a reliable, scientific global index? When Climate Academy
