c) Homo Ludens  
In 1936, the Dutch thinker Johan Huizinger wrote an important book, “Homo Ludens”. His work 
underlines how fundamentally playful human nature is. When play is recognised at a deep level of 
our lives it opens up so many opportunities for a meaningful and wealthy new economic model. 
Returning one last time to Rousseau, in the simplest terms, what we really enjoy are people, not 
products. What we love is community not commodities. We are creatures of purpose and 
playfulness, not merely consumers or customers. 
After a certain level of economic wealth, increases in income do not result in higher levels of well-
being. This is true both for an individual and for the aggregate, whole economy. When we eat the 
11th biscuit from a packet the marginal benefit starts to dip into negative territory.  
All the innovation and progress that has been accomplished since the time of Rousseau, and 
especially during ‘The Great Acceleration’ has brought human civilisation right up to various limits.  
Let’s now enjoy innovating, not only as engineers, but with everything.  Growth is possible in so 
many ways that do not cost the earth. We can be fully human, and live lives of abundance within 
planetary boundaries.  
It’s play time.
