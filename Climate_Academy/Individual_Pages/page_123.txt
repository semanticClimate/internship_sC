described above. Again, to underline the point, the calculations use the 
remaining carbon budgets. These are the only numbers that give a clear 
indication of how well we are doing. These are the numbers that matter 
when we are dealing with a crisis that is rooted in physics and chemistry.  
• 
The emissions reductions required to keep global warming below 2°C are: 
o 4.8% per year (starting from now) for the whole of humanity;  
o 8.3% per year (starting from now) for the EU.  
• 
 The emissions reductions required for the 1.5°C target are (an improbably large): 
o 16.1% per year (starting from now) for the whole of humanity; 
o 27% per year (starting from now) for the EU.   
The numbers are updated annually.  
The numbers for each nation will either rise with inaction or fall with strong action. . 
Behind these averages there are 197 individual nations. It is informative to zoom in on a few of them 
(particularly your own) to get a clearer view. Here is a sample:
