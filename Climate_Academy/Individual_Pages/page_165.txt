For the moment, these realities seem part of a distant world. Yet because they are rooted in our 
truest selves, once there is a movement towards such rewarding advantages, it is hard to imagine 
that that momentum could possibly be reversed.  
The transition to such a world could already be underway; the flickering signals are becoming more 
pronounced – from the impulses of the FFF movement to the stronger policy signals and asset flows 
towards greener energy.  
The paradigm has not yet flipped, and so the most prominent people in the climate movement still 
appear out of key - like time- travellers or futuristic entrepreneurs, like prophets, or like 
philosophers. But every paradigm move has always started like this – it is how things work.  
Spasms, then surge. Convulsions, then calm consensus.   
The flickering, then the flame. 
As Schopenhauer is often quoted as saying, “All truth passes through three phases. First it is 
ridiculed, then it is violently opposed, and finally it is accepted as common sense”.
