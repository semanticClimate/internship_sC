But these huge waves can be fun to surf.  
It is precisely in this context that Lithuanian Climate Academy member Kotryna Nevedomskaité365 
made these posters for our school in Brussels.   
 
 
They are an artistic attempt to draw these issues up to the surface. They are designed to shove the 
imagination to the next level. 
 
Warning: These posters should never be put up in a primary school. Yes, the posters are clumsy. Yes, 
they bluntly crop out the incremental value of those small actions. Yes, if a full audit was made of 
the situation and what solutions need to happen, then all of these individual actions would be crucial 
parts of the whole. Yes, a sustainable society will have dramatically fewer cows and cars, it will be a 
world in which recycling actually happens, and so on.
