The message from the thousands of scientists engaged in climate research over hundreds of 
different angles of research, over decades of peer-reviewed work has been emphatically consistent. 
Science is what we use to predict and the half-life of a radioactive isotopes, to predict the trajectory 
of comets and the development of cancer cells. 
Yes, there is the healthy ambiguity about the margins of their conclusions. It is true that modelling a 
chaotic system involves layers of complex thinking. But, the most basic mechanics of climate change 
have been understood since the early 19th century, and the core details understood with precision 
for decades. 
We have been repeatedly told that we are heading for a catastrophic collision with the forces of 
nature. We have been repeatedly warned that the thresholds in the climate system are now close. 
After these abrupt tipping points, there will be no reverse gear for humans to pull things back to 
stable equilibrium. 
Whatever else happens from here on in, our collective deafness about this crisis is a compelling 
story.
