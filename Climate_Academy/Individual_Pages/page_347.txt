The Power of a Question  
 
Figure 61, “The Castle” (a detail)  https://mymodernmet.com/brick-wall-installation-art-jorge-mendez-blake/ 
 
This is a detail from the brilliant work of art, “The Castle” (2007) by the Jorge Mendes Blake. It shows 
the disruptive power of one book. This mortar-less wall bulges at the place of the text.  
The power that Socrates embodied in his life could be summed up by the singular fact that he   
continually asked the disruptive question. His simple life had a profound impact. Not only on the 
Athenian society of which he was part, but on the rest of western civilization.436  
 
 
436 The fact that the book in this wall is “The Castle” is particularly relevant for the climate crisis, the details of 
this significance can be found in Chapter 14 on Climate Anxiety (that featured the work of Franz Kafka). For 
these concluding pages, it is simply important to notice that both the main character of “The Castle”, “K”, and 
Socrates have lives that share a number of features: both of them had to deal with the banality of the humans 
around them; both tried to engage with a weird passivity in people who were weirdly unconcerned by the big 
questions that overhung their lives; and both “K” and Socrates, in contrast to those in their community, lived 
their lives with startling autonomy.
