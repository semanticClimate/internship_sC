b) Democracy and Capitalism   
 
Figure 56, from "Plato Tackles Climate Change", Pye (2021). 
A simple but important example can be seen in the dynamics between capitalism and democracies 
that do not manage to cap spending on political campaigning (in all its different forms). This diagram 
is taken from “Plato Tackles Climate Change” (2021) and it depicts the feedback loop that is in play 
with our modern democracies. Those countries with the slackest controls on political spending (such 
as the USA) will experience a faster acceleration in the loop, and a more rapid decline of democratic 
dissent, diversity and stabilisers.   
Academic papers that have repeatedly underlined what a remarkably good investment lobbying is 
for a company. For example, Hill et al, concluded that an investment of $1 in lobbying could expect a 
$200 return.406  
Given that the most profitable companies in the world are plugged into fossil fuel, with average 
profits of €2.3bn per day over 50 years (totalling a staggering €42trillion of profits since 1970), it is 
not surprising to find that legislation on emissions has had no teeth at all.407
