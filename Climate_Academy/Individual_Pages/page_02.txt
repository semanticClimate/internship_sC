“As the Head of Philosophy at a European School I used to think that I was 
quite well educated.  
I wasn’t.  
I went to a talk on sustainability in 2012 that blew my head off.  
I only found out about this reality by chance. It should not be like that for 
anyone, especially those who are going to inherit the mess.”

There remains a critical gap in the world’s educational programmes.  
Can we really call our students educated if they do not understand the true 
dimensions and proximity of the climate crisis? 
 Modern education only provides a fragmented, superficial view of what is 
going on above our heads.
