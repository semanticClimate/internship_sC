In fact, a curious feature of how we think about any climate change news is to be so quickly grateful 
for any gesture or move. In the absence of a resolute focus on the remaining carbon budget (as 
explained in the previous Module), the media has no secure handle on what is actually being achieved.  
A list of the meetings is presented here. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The red line, which cuts across the years and the places is going up. 125 126  127 128 
We have gone from 360ppm of CO2 to 418ppm, because we have continued to add excessive amounts 
of CO2 into the atmosphere. In 1995, the year of the first COP meeting, we added an extra 27.8 
gigatonnes of CO2. This number continued to climb through the nineties, and we now emit over 40 
extra gigatons of carbon in a year. This is a very basic observation, but it has to be stated repeatedly.  
The UNFCCC has many sub-groups, from Climate Finance to Climate Technology, from Deforestation 
to Gender, but it has one singular overriding objective. It has to keep anthropogenic interference in 
the atmosphere to a safe level. All of the other targets and outcomes only have any value in how they 
relate to this central aim.  
The UNFCCC is not doing its job.

126 This much hyped ‘lull’ in energy- related CO2 emissions in 2015-2016 was short-lived. Energy CO2 emissions grew at 1.5% 
in 2017, 1.8% in 2018, and so on. The 2020 decrease in emissions because of the global economic slow-down as a result of 
the COVID measures, is expected to be short-lived. Of course, to stop climate change, emissions have to be zero; and to 
reverse the damaging effects of the ramp in CO2 we need to then ‘drawdown’ the greenhouses gases towards 350ppm.

128 Cumulative CO2 emissions until 2100, < 1.5°C, > 67% probability, IPCC (2018) Global Warming of 1.5°C, table 2.2. Limit 
by the end of the mentioned year.
