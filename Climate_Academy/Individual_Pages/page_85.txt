In the graph above, it can be seen that there have been some years during which the rate of increase 
started to flatten out, but this is hardly a comforting fact. If you were a child as a passenger on your 
dad’s bike, and because of his enthusiasm and energy the bike had accelerated at an exponential 
rate, it would be little comfort if he shouted the message: “There is no need to worry” through the 
wind-noise.  
 
Slowing down the rate of increase is not enough. Even if your bike stopped increasing in speed and 
stabilised at 100kmh, it is still going way too fast. Moreover, this is not a flat track, and there are major 
obstacles and bumps ahead.

What is urgently needed is a firm and sensible application of the brakes to actually slow down the bike 
to a speed that is compatible with your survival129. 
 
 
UNFCCC – A School Report  
In the European School system, where my students study, the pass mark is 5 out of 10. A failure to 
meet this average mark means that they must repeat a year of schooling.130 
Throughout the year, the students are presented with their grades in tests and homework across all 
their subjects with marks out of 10. Their continual assessment is provided so that they can know if 
they are on target, and it helps students, teachers and parents make the right interventions in 
adequate time. A student with homework scores of 3/10 in Maths and French, a 7/10 in Art, but with 
4/10 in all the other subjects will clearly be in danger of having to repeat the year.  
It is a clear method of assessment. 
 
129 In fact, to achieve 1.5°C or lower we need to go in reverse, but first we have to slow right down and eventually stop.  
130 There are some small qualifications to this rule, but it is the clear starting point for Class Council considerations.
