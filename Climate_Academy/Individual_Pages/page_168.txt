There is a horse in there, but it is very difficult to spot.  
No one walking down that street in 1900 could have possibly imagined that such a radical 
transformation of New York’s transportation system would happen in just 13 years. But it 
happened.260  
Now imagine a different street. It is 1st December, 1955.  
The city is Montgomery, Alabama.  
This time our attention is focused on the National City Lines bus, N° 2857. It is being driven by a man 
named James F Blake. On board, there is a woman named Rosa Louise McCaulay Parks. She is sitting 
in a seat that she will be asked to give up, once the bus has no more seats available for white people.  
This is the Deep South.  
This is the time of Jim Crow laws - the latest tragic episode in the suffering of black people in the 
USA. Although at the end of the Civil War in 1865, slavery was abolished by the 13th Amendment, 
laws to keep black people in their place proliferated in the South. Racial segregation was enforced 
on buses and trains, in schools and shops, in restaurants and restrooms, in waiting rooms and at 
water fountains.  
And in this deep South sits Rosa Parks. On a bus, four rows back. Heading home.

260 “The Shock of the Anthopocene”, by Christophe Bonneuil and Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, (translated by David 
Fernbach). Verso, 2017. This lucid and brilliantly detailed book lifts the lid on so many transformations such as 
this. Pages 112-116 provide  details on the US transportation’s rapid revolution to the individual car.
