Everything we do, every ambition we have, is plugged in at the most basic level to the biological 
system of the planet. An ecosystem. This system has evolved over millions of years to function at a 
certain average temperature.  Geologists inform us that the last 17,000 years (the ‘Holocene’) have 
been especially stable, favourable and benign. It is simply not possible to suddenly upend this 
equilibrium and throw this system into another gear and expect it to function as we would expect. 
Indeed, if we push it up towards 4°C we will cause a collapse.  
 
Figure 4 50,000 year History of Temperature of Greenland ice surface (C°) (Hansen, 2013). 
At current speeds of emissions, we are only a dozen years or so away from locking in a 2°C rise, and 
we are on course to threaten 4°C by the end of the century.   
The particular problems of temperature rise are of course serious. The plight of the polar bear, 
horrors of hurricane Katrina, all these kinds of details are indeed tragic. However, these symbols of 
climate change have to be pressed to their full symbolic conclusion. Otherwise, we get trapped 
inside local, limited thinking and acting – and to be blunt, it is not good enough.
