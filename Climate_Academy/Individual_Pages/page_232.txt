Rousseau’s rosy cheeks and curly wig hardly instil a confidence in us that he will have something 
robust or piercing to say.  
 
However, decades before the Industrial Revolution had made one singular rotation of a steam train 
wheel, Rousseau was thinking along very perceptive lines into the future. With remarkable clarity of 
mind, what he could see down the track of human civilisation were the key issues that confront us 
today as we approach different planetary boundaries.  
 
As will hopefully become clear, Rousseau will be an excellent tour guide about the issue of 
innovation. He wrote his books in the Age of the Enlightenment, but they are sharply relevant for 
our age, which from a certain angle, might be called the Age of Entitlement.   
  
This chapter will follow some of his key questions and ideas that he posed. It will pull them together 
into six areas of enquiry. These sections will parallel the development in Rousseau’s own life and 
works. They start by a recognition of a problem that is not recognised by contemporary culture. In 
Rousseau’s case this was the countercultural insight that that innovation is not always a good thing, 
and that advances in the arts and sciences could even amplify some seriously negative aspects of the 
human condition.  
 
Then after exposing some cultural myths, it will follow Rousseau’s lead in thinking through ways in 
which these problems can be overcome or transcended. Again, he will prompt us to think about 
innovation at a deeper level than our current culture is used to doing.
