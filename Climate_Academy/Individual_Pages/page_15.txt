thresholds. By having a clear central reference point, students in the Climate Academy can indulge 
their particular interests and skills whilst enjoying a sense of coherence. It is the seat that really 
helps line everything else up into view. 
 
But of course, the Climate Academy is not about sitting down.  
After getting a systems view of things, it is time for action. The second pillar of the Academy is all 
about engaging in the democratic space: peer teaching, events, projects, publications in writing, 
pictures, videos and other media. For this, you can work in collaboration with the wonderful youth 
journalism organization, News Decoder.  
And finally, as the students experience the friction and the flows involved trying to raise a proper 
systems awareness of the crisis, certain ‘meta’ skills will start to arise. These are the funky, creative 
skills of systems entrepreneurship. These are the ‘deep green’ competences: problem framing, 
political autonomy, engaging with complexity, resilience, critical thinking, strategic communication 
and networking, , and so on.  
What’s not to like?  
So many students aged 16-18 are not given the chance to understand the climate crisis in its proper 
depth. So many do not have the chance to explore their own skills and interests in a safe and 
constructive space. The Climate Academy is not for everyone, it doesn’t have to be.  
Harvard Professor of Political Science, Erica Chenoweth, found that throughout human history, 
major social change has only ever needed (no more than) 3.5% of the population to really engage. 
Or as Margaret Mead once wrote, ““Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed, 
(global) citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”  
If you are reading this introduction, it could well have landed in this situation because you are one of 
those change makers.
