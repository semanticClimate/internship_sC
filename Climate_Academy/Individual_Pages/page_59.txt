WHERE ARE WE NOW? 
 
 
If we had a beep to signal the situation, we have with climate change then that beep would be 
increasing in pitch. In fact, the beep has always been increasing in pitch and the intervals between 
those signals would be continually shortening.  
This can be seen in the graph below which represents the last ** years of our greenhouse gas 
emissions. It clearly demonstrates the upward momentum of our greenhouse gases emissions. We are 
not decreasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; we are still accelerating their increase. The line 
on the graph is going up, and new records are being set every year.8283  
In the last 30 years, radiative forcing (the technical label for the ‘warming effect’) has risen 49%. The 
overall average increase was 0.03 w/m2 per year, but the last 5-year average was 0.04 w/m2 per 
year.84   
A rise from 2.1 to 3.1 W/m2 radiative forcing might not sound like a lot, but when the 1 Watt per 
square meter increase is cashed out into a different set of units, the reality of it all is rather amazing. 
A 1W per m2 increase across the entire earth’s surface amounts to a 510 trillion-Watt force.  
This upturn is the equivalent of 600,000 Hiroshima nuclear bomb explosions per day.85

85 Increase of 1 W = 1 J / s, earth surface 510.1 trillion m2, thus increase 1 W/m2 equals 510 TJ / s for total earth surface. Energy content 
of Hiroshima bomb ‘Little Boy’ is estimated to be equivalent to 63 TJ. Increase of 1 W/m2 is the equivalent of 510 / 63 = 7.6 ‘little boys’ per 
second or about 600,000 Hiroshima nuclear bombs per day for earth.
