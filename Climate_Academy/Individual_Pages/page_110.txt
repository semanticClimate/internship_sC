example, but there are thousands of contrasts that could be made, and all of them carry the same 
message. The bottom line is that we need to equitably reduce our consumption down to levels that 
are compatible with a stable atmosphere. Contrary to the infinite imagination of a market economy, 
the laws of physics and chemistry insist that those limits to material growth are there. Every car 
added to the world by a UK customer fills a space in the remaining ecological budgets that cannot be 
taken up by someone from Pakistan. 
All these issues are embedded in the contrasting numbers of the CUTx index. One last time, the 
United Kingdom needs to cut emissions by 27%pa for 1.5°C and 8.1%pa for the 2°C limit, whereas 
Pakistan only needs to reduce their emissions by 1.1%pa for 1.5°C and could even increase their 
emissions by 1.4%pa for 2°C.   
Despite the UHD nations claiming to be in the lead with climate change, the data does not agree. In 
the build-up to COP26 in Glasgow, the UK claimed to have “the world’s most ambitious climate 
change target”184. However, that should make us choke on our rice. When the commitment is 
squared up to the standard global measure offered by the CUTx index, the UK ranks amongst the 
worst.  
The graphic below illustrates that the UHD nations have simply not shifted the dial on their 
emissions since the 1970s. For every efficiency created, more consumption has filled the gap. 
Instead of having one inefficient light bulb in every room of the house, we now have hundreds of 
efficient LEDs. And in the background, the High and Medium developed nations, such as India, 
Bangladesh and Pakistan, are pushing up their emissions as they industrialise their economies.
