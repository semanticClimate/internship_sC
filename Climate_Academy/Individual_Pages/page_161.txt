Japanese is not better or worse than Italian or Finnish. Each scientific paradigm provides us with 
access to a different layer of reality, just as each language of the world opens up a fresh world of 
symbols and angles on experience for us to live with.    
Indeed, the word “paradigm”, after the pioneering work of Kuhn, has been used and developed in 
fields much wider than scientific knowledge. Most notably, the fruity philosophy of Foucault was 
committed to exposing how what seems “normal” to a society is in fact the product of different 
power interests. His work will be mobilised in Chapter 11. It is just interesting to note here that 
Foucault’s use of “paradigms”, like Kuhn, undertakes a historical survey of the past to better 
illuminate the present. His analysis of our current value systems, and the limits of what we can 
imagine, and dream is both audacious and powerful.
