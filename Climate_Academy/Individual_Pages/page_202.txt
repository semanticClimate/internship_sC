Reflection Number Four 
Cognitive Dissonance 
It is a weird truth about climate change that so many beautifully good things have a climate change 
shadow to them. We are all part of a Closed Mass System, so therefore every movement and 
gesture, every act and gift – even if they are deeply loving, carry with them a carbon cost. Here are a 
few scattered examples that are constructed from some of the data in “How Bad are Bananas? – The 
carbon cost of everything” (2010). From the very small, to the very big:  
• 
The reassuring email message sent by a friend who is concerned about how you are coping 
with a highly pressurised day at work (0.014 grammes of CO2e) and follows up later in the 
day with an email (4gCO2e) but forgets to attach a lovely picture of a sunset (50gCO2e).  
• 
A birthday gift to a nephew: a pair of shoes, 11.5kg CO2e 
• 
A £500 new Welsh gold necklace 22kg gCO2e 
• 
A wedding anniversary night celebrated in an average B&B, including meals and drinks: 25kg 
CO2e 
• 
A London-Glasgow return trip to attend COP26  
o By bike: 53kg CO2e (if you eat bananas for energy) 
o By coach: 63kg CO2e 
o By plane: 500kg CO2e 
o By large 4wD car: 1100kg CO2e 
• 
A mobile phone, used for one hour a day, per year: 1250kg CO2e 
• 
The birth of a child (life expectancy 79 years, living an average UK life): 373 tonnes CO2e.  
• 
The World Cup (South Africa, 2010): 2.8 million tonnes CO2e 
• 
The world’s data centres: c.250 million tonnes CO2e 
This collection of moments is not compiled to provoke guilt about every gesture that we make. It is 
simply put together to underline the cognitive dissonance that will remain in our society until the 
infrastructure of our economies is redeemed to a deep shade of green.    
The current plethora of carbon “off-set” claims are dangerously misleading. There are only really two 
ways to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, the first is to reduce our 
consumption, and I can’t remember what the second one is.288  
Oh yes, I do remember. It is to draw down carbon from the atmosphere using advanced technology. 
However, we are a zillion miles (or several trillion dollars and many decades) away from anything 
close to the capacity required.289  
 
 
 
288 Mark Hanna, a wealthy industrialist and Senator from Ohio wryly commented back in 1895: “There are two 
things that are really important in politics, the first is money, and I can’t remember what the second one is”. 
289 In fact, even if we were to invent such technology it would have require a large bump in emissions to 
fabricate it and it would need to be put somewhere.
