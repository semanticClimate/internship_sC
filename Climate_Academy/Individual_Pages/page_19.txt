Chapter One 
The Absolute Basics 
In this opening chapter points at the vital statistic for human life on this planet: 
the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  
Why should 426 particles of CO2 in every million particles matter? It is a tiny 
amount. How could such small thing be such a big deal? Why should we be 
bothered about remote, abstract, scientific facts?  
The Climate Academy is committed to a providing a clear systemic viewpoint. 
Without this perspective, it is easy to miss what really matters.  
Greenhouse gases matter because they raise the temperature of the 
atmosphere. And this temperature has to be understood systemically. Your 
body is a bio-system, and it cannot cope with even a small change in 
temperature across the system. It is called a fever, and it is has miserable side-
effects. For a human, an extra 4°C for the body is a medical emergency.  
Likewise, the Earth is a large bio-system. You cannot suddenly shunt up the 
temperature up, without massive consequences.  
This book starts with these absolutely basic system facts. These facts are not 
visible without the help of scientific research and graphs. But they really do 
matter.
