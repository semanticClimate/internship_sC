itself, who publish their own projections with this highly optimistic assumption included in the 
algorithm. This was true of the Emission Gap report that was published by the UN in 2019*.  
 
It seems to be neither correct, nor transparent, to have such reductions in greenhouse gases included 
in the graphs, yet they almost always are. It is a bit like fiddling the milage dial on your car.  
In the absence of a handbrake turn by our juggernaut of emissions, a rise of 1.5°C is inevitable.92  
Chapter 7 on “Cut 11%” will articulate exactly how sharp the emissions reductions will have to be for 
each nation of the world to duck under the 1.5°C threshold. Importantly, the numbers used by the 
Climate Academy do not include any unproven capacity for negative emissions. A move that seems 
like an entirely scientific way to go about things93 and in line with simple common sense. Indeed, the 
calculations in Cut11% also stay well clear of a dabble with in the scientifically and ethically dubious 
potentials of geoengineering. 
If the media reporting was more transparent about the current path that we are on, then the 
projections would show that we are actually heading for a rise of around 4°C by 2100.  Another way 
of stating the facts is to acknowledge that the current NDCs only add up to a commitment that is one 
sixth of what is required,94,95  and even with this on the table, many major industrialised nations are 
not even on track to fulfil these limited commitments.96  
The skewed reality that follows from being far too optimistic about carbon capture technology 
unsurprisingly also skews the language and framing of the reporting of the climate crisis. For example, 
the BBC’s Science Correspondent, Matt McGrath, published an article just before COP21 in which he 
reported that 15 leading Buddhists, including the Dalai Lama, had called for the Paris Agreement to 
limit warming to 1.5°C. However, no comment was made about this ambition being so highly 
improbable.97  This is just one example, but once you have understood the 2 year proximity of 1.5°C 
and the cliff face that emissions will have to fall down to meet that target, it is impossible not to follow 
most media output with a sense of incredulity.  
As stated above, the ultimate goal must be to not only restrict warming to 1.5°C but drag it down 
towards zero. But this is not going to happen if we massage the numbers to look more comfortable. It 
seems imperative to be square and blunt with what is going on above our heads, a softening of the 
truth is most likely to lead to a softening of response.
