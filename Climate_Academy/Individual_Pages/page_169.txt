The bus comes to a stop in front of the Empire Theatre. The driver James F Blake gets out from 
behind the wheel, “Y’all better make it light on yourselves and let me have those seats”. 261 
She refuses. She is arrested.  
Rosa Parks does not know it – but a social tipping point is underway.  
 
The significance of the event will only be clear later. She will be put on trial in four days’ time and 
fined $10. On the day of the trial 35,000 leaflets will be distributed calling on black people to boycott 
the buses in Montgomery. A man named Martin Luther King will become the leader of a protest 
movement that will develop unstoppable momentum.  
Between the seemingly insignificant defiance of Rosa Parks on a bus seat on 1st December, 1955, and 
the signing of the Civil Rights Act by President Johnson in a Presidential seat, there was a gap of just 
nine years.  
 
261 Rosa Parks recognised the driver. A few weeks before, Mr. Blake had accelerated away, abandoning her in 
the rain on the sidewalk. She had bought a ticket onboard, but disembarked because the law required her to 
pay, get off, and reboard the bus at the back – if she was lucky enough to get there in time.
