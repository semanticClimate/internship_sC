The first seemingly obvious point is that the Earth is limited. A spaceship might be 100  metres 
wide60, and the Earth is much wider - at 12,756 kilometres diameter. However, they both have their 
limits. Again, to state the obvious, there is only a certain amount of space onboard planet Earth. 
These simplistic statements need to be held in view for a while in order to squeeze out some 
consequent truths that we might not have grasped so clearly.  
 
 
Figure 7 The Blue Marble is a famous photograph of the Earth taken on December 7, 1972, by the crew of the 
Apollo 17 spacecraft en route to the Moon at a distance of about 29,400 kilometres (18,300 mi). 
 
For example, in 2020, 81 million people were added to the planet61 – a number broadly equivalent to 
the population of Germany. This figure is in line with the long-term average annual growth of about 
1.3%62. Back in the 1990’s the late Physics Professor Al Bartlett famously calculated that if the world 
population continued to grow at 1.3% per year, such a growth rate would lead to a population 
density of one person per square metre on the dry land surface of the earth in 790 years. That is not
