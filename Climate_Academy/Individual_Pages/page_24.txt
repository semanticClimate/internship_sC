The Absolute Basics 
 
Let’s be frank6.  
 
There is no point investing any further time reading this book or engaging in any urgent efforts to fix 
the climate crisis, if there is no such crisis (or if it is already much too late to do anything significant 
about it). We all have other stuff we could be getting on with. The basic science of our situation must 
be very robust; getting the evidence straight is fundamentally important. This respect for data and the 
latest conclusions of mainstream science avoids two dangers:  it prevents us from being too casual 
about the severity of the crisis we are in, and it prevents us from undue alarmism. 
 
Any book worth the effort on climate change must therefore be written on a rock-solid scientific base. 
Not only that, a decent book on climate change has to provide a proper landscape of the situation. It 
is easy to get lost in the details, it is easy to miss what the central conclusions are. This opening module 
will put this important frame in place.  
 
There are two absolutely basic issues to address here: global warming, and greenhouse gases (GHG).

It is easy to understand why A Square found it difficult to see the hidden depths of A Sphere. Although 
the suppression and punishments that A Square suffered are clearly not to be applauded, it is easy to 
understand how whacked out his claims must have seemed to everyone in Flatland. Likewise, there 
are significant psychological and political obstacles to seeing the reality of climate change. These will 
be given their proper attention in the Module 10.  
 
But honestly, there is not much excuse for any kind of hesitation – look at the chart above.
