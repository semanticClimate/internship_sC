The Psychology of Climate Change 
This chapter will have a different rhythm.  
There are so many diverse angles to the Psychology of Climate Change it would almost be a waste of 
time trying to find a storyline through them. In order to to keep that diversity alive, this chapter will 
just be a bundle of reflections that will hopefully inspire further reflections.  
It is as simple as that.  
Reflection Number One  
On an odd kind of deafness 
Although I am only (?) in my forties, my children find it very amusing to test my hearing with an 
online test. They can hear the beep just after the category “Superhuman”, whereas I consistently 
only tap the table once the dial has reached all the way down to, “90-year-old WWII artillery 
veteran”. I’m not sure if the problem is genetic, or if my hearing was ‘Mahlerised’ by the percussion 
section who threw themselves with such conviction into all the orchestra rehearsals of my youth. I 
suppose it would be cooler to claim that my loss of hearing was due to hours of frenzied thrash 
metal band practice amongst the empty pizza boxes and beer cans of a friends’ garage. But that 
story is only true in a universe parallel to this one.

Some have suggested, including my doctor, that the profile of my hearing loss provides me with a 
wonderful alibi. This is because it is very localised, at the typical frequency of a child and a female 
voice. 
Of course, being a bit deaf is not great. But this particular kind of ‘narrow’ deafness seems far more 
widespread than we might think.
