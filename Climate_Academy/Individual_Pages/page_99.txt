people living in areas vulnerable to drought. Those still proud of the British Empire might imagine 
that the famines occurred because the advances in transport, communications (and so on) had not 
yet embedded themselves into the economy. Some might think that the repeated crises were due to 
limited local infrastructure which makes mismanagement, inefficiencies and logistical failure hard to 
avoid. Or perhaps, at a very general level, some onlookers would simply write off the deaths as 
‘natural disasters’, arbitrary swipes of fate at humanity, by an uncaring, hostile universe.    
The uncomfortable truth is that these deaths were almost entirely avoidable (the evidence will be 
unfolded later).  
Colonial rule came with a set of priorities that did not include the health and welfare of the people it
