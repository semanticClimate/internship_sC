gaining control over the content and approach of climate change awareness has been to wage a war 
on plastics and a reduction in their use - a savvy way to look ethical and skew our thinking towards 
individual action. Indeed, the cause of reducing plastics is very visual and tactile. For example, not 
taking a plastic bag in a supermarket feels good, but in this case, it is carbon footprint of all the food 
and stuff that beeped past the check-out that really matters. Just to press home the point, all 
plastics are only responsible for one in every 256* tonnes of our greenhouse gas emissions. So, their 
reduction hardly makes a difference to the climate, and it makes little difference to the profit lines of 
these major companies. 
Conclusion 
The vital statistics of our planet do not look good. But with respect for science and a deeper love of 
human life and all the insane  
Which just need to come out from under the bewitching spell of the self. We need to take our 
individual, consumption-based thinking and enlarge it. The beautiful and powerful truth about the 
fight for climate justice is that an engagement in projects that are aimed at systemic change involve 
our whole self, not just the cropped version of humanity that we have adjusted ourselves to.
