420 parts per million16 does not sound like a lot, it is only like a can of coke sat in the corner of a 
classroom. However, a carbon reading of 420 ppm informs us that we have bumped up the level of 
CO2 by almost 50% since the start of the Industrial age.17 
This is a concentration of CO2 that is unprecedented in around 4 million years and when geologists 
look back in time to previous epochs that had the same levels of CO2 they do not see a world which is 
compatible with human civilisation as it is now: “Current levels of CO2 correspond to an equilibrium 
climate last observed 3-5 million years ago, a climate that was 2-3°C warmer than today, and sea levels 
that were 10-20 m higher than those today.”18 
It will take us into an utterly alien world for our species. This is a kind of situation that is very hard for 
us homo sapiens to even think about. 
 
16 To be exact, the global average for 2021 was 416ppm. The 420 ppm that was measured in Mauna Loa is a reading taken 
at a particular moment in the annual zig-zag of concentrations caused by the four seasons. 
17 These figures do not include the other greenhouse gases like methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N20) and halogens.
