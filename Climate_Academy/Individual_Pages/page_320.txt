Complex System Theory there is a concept, “the edge of chaos”412 which, essentially predicts that 
“the truly creative changes and the big shifts occur right at the edge of chaos.”413  
We are right now at that junction. Perhaps things have never looked worse, but this is not 
necessarily the worst news. Just like we don’t always see catastrophe coming, we can also be blind-
sided by sudden upward, regenerative gear changes.  
For such a deep, transdisciplinary field of enquiry, it is simply impossible now to control all the 
qualifications need to write about this scientific discipline with proper control. Complex Systems 
Theory is a bit of a truth bomb.  
What is informative for a brief introduction to systems level climate change thinking is that humans 
now have an unprecedented ability to see clearly into the future and to discern the deepest 
dynamics beyond the surface of things. We have not yet crossed over a global, irreversible planetary 
threshold. The game is still on.  
What is absolutely essential is that we do not look away from the full picture.
