His humour is not word play, nor is it slapstick buffoonery. There are no innuendos or farting, and it 
is not written to provoke the canned laughter of a sitcom.  “What Kafka's stories have, rather, is a 
grotesque and gorgeous and thoroughly modem complexity. Kafka's humour -not only not neurotic, 
but anti-neurotic - is heroically sane”.379  
Communication of key climate change reality is so difficult. The human mind just fuses out with too 
much negative information, yet we have to be able to look at such facts sometimes and put them in 
the public space. This dimension to Kafka is a helpful reminder that irony and humour affords us the 
chance to be deep, and yet sustain engagement.  
Indeed, it is precisely when we are stripped down to face the most basic questions, when all our 
fundamental assumptions about reality are overthrown, that we are drawn into states of mind that 
can give birth to the most original and creative responses in us.  
Irony is not superficial gift. Our ability to understand and deploy it is essential when faced with 
monumental truths. Irony enables us to engage in an unflinching and direct way with the most 
terrible things, without diluting or cropping them. Of course, irony and sarcasm can be a tactic used 
by some to deflect hard truths away.  
When the skill of irony is used authentically, it offers us a wonderfully powerful way to handle and 
communicate the toughest of truths. In this context it is informative to remember George Orwell’s 
comment, that “every joke is a tiny revolution” & “to be funny, indeed, you have got to be serious”.
