nagging temptations to let it slip. Laws that liberate us to really invest our attention, energy and 
creativity into deeply healthy stuff. 
Time has slipped by with every single COP meeting since they started in 1995. 
 
  
Everything has been kept to the low level of ambition of voluntary actions. COP26 in Glasgow was no

We don’t have a gradualist approach to fixing the problems of gas leaks in schools, so why do we

ambiguity at a political level. The main conclusions of this “Leviathan” (1651) remain highly informative, both 
about psychology at work at an individual level and how that then plays out at a national level (and in the 
modern age, at an international level).
