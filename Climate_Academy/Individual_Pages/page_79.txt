We live in now.  
 
The latest data shows that we must not look back on the ancien regime as if it were some backward 
period of history, when inequality used to be rampant. We must not crop our view of the present, by 
imagining that inequality has been tamed and that its visceral power to destroy lives has been 
overcome. If anything, we should lament our own inability to get a grip on it. In 2022, the top 10% 
still own a whopping 76% of the global wealth118, and the top 1% still own just below 50% of all 
wealth119. In fact, we could push it further and note that the top 0.01% own 11% of global wealth. 
 
And it should be no surprise to find out that these figures for wealth are a mirror of who is 
responsible for global emissions. The details of this inequality will be unpacked in the following 
chapter. If you only have the bare essentials to live, you hardly have the resources or time to create 
huge greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, there were 3.9 billion people who hardly own anything at 
all; they can only claim a dismal 2% of the worlds’ wealth between them.   
 
It seems incontestable that the space above our head should be shared equally amongst all people 
of the world. It would cause an outrage if people standing in a room started bottling up the air for 
themselves to breathe, thereby depriving others of their equal right to oxygen. Yet, for over a 
century, the industrially advanced nations of the world have been tipping their emissions into the 
shared atmosphere at an astonishing speed, and therefore we now have a situation where people 
are already dying because of it.   
 
There is one atmosphere. We all have an equal right to it.
