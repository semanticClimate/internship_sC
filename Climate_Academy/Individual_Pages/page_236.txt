The limits of Spaceship Earth are absolute. They are nothing to do with sentiment or politics, 
optimism or pessimism. They are just there. These limits are defined by Physics, Chemistry and 
Biology. Or, if we zoom out to a more complete view, they are factual limits, understood by complex 
Earth Systems science.  
 
For example, the development of the electric car has caught the headlines in recent years. This 
innovation is often cited as an example of ‘Sustainable Development’. An electric car is widely 
considered to be a way for a company or an individual to signal their environmental commitments.  
 
However, firstly, it is not innovative. In the year 1900, approximately one third of all vehicles in the 
USA were electric, the demand was so strong that in the year 1901 both Thomas Edison started 
exploring more efficient battery power, and Ferdinand Porsche turned his attention to hybrid power.  
 
Secondly, and most fundamentally, in the year 1900 we extracted 7 billion tonnes of material from 
the Earth’s crust. In 2022, total resource extractions went up to 103 billion tonnes for the year.325 A 
car, with all its myriad parts and electrics, metals and materials, is part of that monumental 
expansion. The maximum sustainable threshold is considered to be 50 billion tonnes per year, so we 
are already doing twice as much as we can sustain. But, astonishingly, we are on course to hit a 
demand for 200 billion tonnes of extraction by 2050.  
 
Now let’s be clear. There are not armies of goblins or pixies going out at night to dig up these 
resources just for the fun of it. The crust of the Earth is not secretly being dismantled by aliens. It is 
true that for most people in highly developed nations, this profound disruption is happening way out 
of sight; but there is an absolute and direct connection between these pockets of violence against 
the natural world and the lifestyle choices that most humans aspire to. This massive, accelerating 
disruption to the Earth is happening because of the rising demand for products that we a consuming.  
 
The graph from the UN statistic division326 shows that, apart from a very minor kink around 2008, 
every time we increase GDP, we also push up our resource extractions.  
 
 
325 ‘United Nations Material Flow Database’ (2022 update) : extraction and consumption of natural resources 
increased from 30 billion tonnes in 1970 to 96 billion tonnes in 2019, an average annual increase of 2.4%. 
Projected forward at 2.4% growth per year, extraction of resources reaches 103 billion tonnes in 2022, and 106 
billion tonnes in 2023.
