Conclusion 
 
 
Back to the Cornflakes   
 
 
The next time we open a box of cornflakes and feel cheated 
by the empty space, we should remind ourselves that if it 
weren’t for that bubble of air packaged inside the bag, our 
morning breakfast would be much poorer for it.  
 
We all appreciate the evenly sized cornflakes that pour into 
our breakfast bowl. Each individual one has survived the long 
bumpy ride from the factory to the table, and it has found a 
secure niche, right next to its close neighbours. In fact, there 
is no need for the slightly apologetic words of the 
manufacturers, that “The contents might have settled during 
transit”, because that is exactly what they are supposed to do.  
 
Nobody with any experience of breakfast would want a soggy 
bowl full of corn dust, perhaps with just a few lucky surviving 
flakes.  
 
The air above the cornflakes really matters. 
 
It is time that we clicked, ‘back’ or ‘restore’ on our image of 
ourselves and of our society. David’s Tennis Court Oath painting can help us be bold enough to look 
back at the fullest picture of ourselves. Yes, we are capable of idiocy and violence. Yes, we have let 
fear and anger crush us in the past. But Sylvan Bailly is pointing to a wonderful space that exists 
above our heads.  
 
Let’s be bold enough to fill it with solidarity, courage and respect.  
 
Let’s be smart enough to scaffold it with science- based laws about the climate.
