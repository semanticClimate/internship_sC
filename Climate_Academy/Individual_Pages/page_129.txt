If the media was to start consistently using these numbers, instead of accepting the standard 
knotted format that has no relationship to the actual carbon budget, it would surely help sharpen 
the public mandate to take the necessary steps.  
Catastrophe by stealth should not be possible.  
Everyone has the Right to Know the truth about the vital statistics of the planet.  
 
Science-based laws 
 
The suffragists had a clear goal – a woman’s right to vote. The Civil Rights Movement also had a clear 
goal – full racial equality before the law. The Climate Movement should also have a clear goal – the 
establishment of science-based climate laws.  
For the moment, the slogans and speeches of the climate marches are very powerful and moving – 
but until they consolidate around a demand for laws that are based on the reality of the chemistry 
and physics of the atmosphere, those in power will find it easy to agree with all the sentiments and 
problems… and then carry on doing nothing. In the absence of a specific demand for laws that frame 
human development within safe limits, we are observing that the beauty and depth embodied in the 
protest movement just triggers admiration but does not lead to the required action. The climate 
movement cannot afford to just become cultural wallpaper.
