their true costs”. These thoughts are echoed by Sir Nicholas Ster:, “This very important analysis 
shatters the myth that fossil fuels are cheap by showing just how huge their real costs are.”276

There is a very fine line between the current perception of climate change and a situation where the 
penny drops. Anyone who “gets it” about climate change, can sense immediately in a conversation if 
the person they are talking to also “gets it”. There is a shared sense of incredulity at the limpness of 
our responses, and a restlessness about getting beyond the clichés that tangle so knottily around our 
feet. The odd, but uplifting truth is that there are millions of people who do “get it”.   It is therefore 
more than plausible to suggest that the situation that we are faced with in climate change is not 
dissimilar to the major shifts in social perception in our past.  
A tipping point could be close.  
Consider the thresholds between different states of H2O. The freezing point of water at 0°C marks 
the line between two utterly distinct conditions. Underneath this level, the molecules are bound 
together in a compact state; above this level everything is loosened up. They are the same individual 
molecules, but the external temperature changes everything about the state that they are in. There 
is a critical melting point. And crucially, that threshold line is wafer thin.
