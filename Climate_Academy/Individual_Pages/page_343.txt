worry about, and no private interests to protect. In fact, as noted earlier, they were explicitly banned 
from ownership of any property to avoid any shadow of self-interest in their affairs. They were there 
with only one purpose – to wrestle with the truth about the nature of things.  
 
The free thought of the Climate Academy is not facilitated by slavery (of course). However, it is 
fundamentally important that the Academy programme is not compromised by any commercial 
interests. We only accept funding or support from organisations that do not interfere with the 
conclusions of mainstream science about the defining planetary boundaries. The scientists behind 
the CUTx Index are entirely independent and have made the index as simple as possible (without 
compromising any science).  
 
Indeed, all the materials of the Climate Academy are downloadable for free. This reduces the 
barriers to entry into the world of systems understanding to the minimum possible. In short, the 
only agenda in both Academies is an open and reflective wrestle with reality and justice.
