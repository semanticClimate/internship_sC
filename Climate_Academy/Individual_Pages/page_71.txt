Introduction 
 
Conflakes 
    
 
 
It is hard not to feel cheated when you open a box of cornflakes. The large box promises a lot. But 
once you open the cardboard flaps, you see that nearly a third of it turns out to be just a lot of air.    
    
‘Conflakes’.  Surely. Not Cornflakes.   
    
At first sight David’s famous painting of ‘The Tennis Court Oath’ looks rather similar.  
 
There is a lot of useless air here too. Half the picture in fact.  
 
If a child brought home from school a drawing proportioned like this, you would enthusiastically 
praise it and smile – but quietly think to yourself that there was a lot of wasted space. In fact, David’s 
painting might remind you of those pictures that you get when you ask a child to take a photograph. 
The resulting image, taken by someone of such inexperience with a camera, will probably have a 
whole lot of sky or landscape… and at the bottom of the frame, you might just see your decapitated 
head, happily smiling. 
 
If we are to accuse David of further childish mistakes with the picture, we could also point out that 
his painting is not even coloured in. What is David doing? Why have these basic mistakes been 
made?
