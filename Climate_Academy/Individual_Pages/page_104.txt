When the first boats landed in India, they docked on the shores of the second largest economy in 
the world: the Moghul Empire155 accounted for 23.4% of world trade156, it was second only to the 
Ming Dynasty in China. Then from the coastal fringes, through a combination of trade and conquest, 
the East India Company drove out rival French and Dutch settlements in the subcontinent, and 
annexed various Moghul provinces. By the early 1800s, the company had grown so powerfully, it 
actually matched the ‘mothership’ British economy in size (including a near monopoly on the world 
trade of tea) and it could afford to sustain a standing 
army of 260,000 men157 (double the size of the British 
Army).  
The East India Company had become the de facto 
state in India and beyond; it was a nation run by 
shareholders through “merchant-statesmen”.  
Think Google with Guns, Amazon with Ammunition, 
or Murdoch with Militia.   
It even had a funky company flag for its three army groups158 to go into battle with.  
This romp of capitalist expansion from 1600, seemingly hit a barrier in 1857, when a local rebellion 
against the company kicked off.159 The British found it was relatively easy to tame. However, it did 
force London into a quick game of musical chairs. Seats and offices moved around, personnel and 
privileges were shuffled, and when the music stopped, Queen Victoria found herself as Empress of 
India. She had won the jewel in the crown. From 1858 the land and people of India were under the 
rule of “The British Raj”. 160   
The East India Company had been nationalized, but this rebranding left the same operating system 
in place. It didn’t make any difference which kind of flag was flying in Calcutta, Delhi or Bombay. The 
key objective was profit. From agriculture to textiles, from urban to rural, from the short to the long 
term, decisions were to be measured in yields and returns. The great governing algorithm of British 
calculations had revenue at the centre. 
 
  
 
 
 
155 As with all empires, past and present, the division of wealth was skewed sharply towards the elite; as 
confirmed by Broadberry S. and Gupta B., “INDIA AND THE GREAT DIVERGENCE: AN ANGLO-INDIAN 
COMPARISON OF GDP PER CAPITA, 1600-1871” (2012).

159 On the surface, it was triggered by refusal of the Indian army members (‘sepoy’) to bite the caps off the 
bullet cartridges that came with their new Enfield rifles, because they were out of pig or cow skin. Underneath 
this key issue were a huge range of background religious and cultural tensions that the British had becoming 
increasingly clumsily with.
