Finding the right seat (N°1) 
 
The bottom line 
 
As the Head of Philosophy at a European School I used to think that I was quite well educated. I 
wasn’t. I went to a talk on sustainability in 2012 that blew my head off. I was sat on the third row 
from the front to the left, in the Belgian Academy of Science. It was an evening that left a deep print 
on me.  
 
I only found out about this reality by chance.  
It should not be like that for anyone.  
 
Especially not for those who are going to inherit the mess.  
 
The details 
There are some things that a modern education should obviously provide. Literacy and numeracy 
should be at the centre; the first enhanced by the human sciences, the second advanced by the 
natural sciences. It should also cultivate skills in sport, art, music, and an appreciation of the beauty 
of themselves and the other. 
 
There is some core content too that it would be neglectful to miss. It would not be right if a student 
completed his studies with a full understanding of Norse mythology but had no awareness of the 
Holocaust. Schools should not send students into the world with an understanding of mitochondrial 
DNA and little understanding of what a penis can do. 
 
Pause. 
 
It is not profoundly weird? 
 
We are in the middle of a mass extinction event. These have only happened 5 times before in the 
4.54 (± 0.05) billion year history of our planet. This is something even more dramatic than an 
Olympic medal for San Marino. Climate change has put human civilization under the most acute and 
urgent pressure to make fundamental changes to how do we do things, otherwise we will soon have 
a catastrophic collision with the forces of nature. 
 
Yet.
