Guernica  
 
As a headbanging reminder of the carnage that total disrespect for human life can cause in a 
technological age, there is a work of art that deserves note: Picasso’s “Guernica”. A tapestry copy of it 
was hung up in the UNHQ building and provided a backdrop to hundreds of UN statements concerning 
conflict around the world. If we look up here, we can see the eye of an electric bulb illuminating a 
horrifying scene of suffering.  
 
 
 
Guernica used to be a quiet, unassuming village in the Basque region of Spain. Then in 1937, on 26th  
April , at 16:30, the villagers were compelled to look up at the sky. It had suddenly turned formidably 
noisy and menacing. They would be bombed relentlessly for four hours by the German Luftwaffe. This 
test-drive of Blitzkrieg tactics turned Guernica to rubble and blew impossibly wide wounds into the lives 
of hundreds of innocent victims.  
 
Picasso took on the task of capturing the awful scale of the demolition on canvas. He produced a work 
of remarkable claustrophobic intensity. He framed a mangled pile-up of the modern and the mythical, 
in which a screaming mother and a dead baby are thrown into a writhing mass of dismembered horses, 
bulls and body parts.  
 
When Picasso’s apartment was taken over by the Nazis, in the later occupation of Paris, the SS soldiers 
reportedly noticed a copy of the Guernica painting. They asked Picasso, “Did you do this?”. To which 
Picasso answered tersely, “No. You did”.  
 
Great art cuts through the noise. Great art has a timeless power.
