Two very important qualifications 
If your antennae are sensitive to climate change news, or if you engaged enough to dig around on 
the internet to find out more about where we are up to, the figures of 2.7-3°C from the graph above 
might sound broadly familiar. For example, the BBC often cites numbers in this range, or even 
below90.      
 
However, two crucial qualifications are needed. 
 
a) Negative emission 
The graph above is actually misleading. Indeed, it is very 
misleading. It looks like, with all the recent NDCs added together 
from the different nations and with those commitments fully 
implemented, we would be able to drag the temperature rise 
down to 2.7-3°C. But within the algorithms that are used to make 
all the projections of those lines, there is a huge assumption 
about our ability to suck out greenhouse gases from the 
atmosphere with technology.  
The problem? This technology does not exist, nor is it close to 
existing. It is imagined that we are able to suck CO2 out of the 
atmosphere on a truly massive industrial level with engineering 
that does yet exist.91  
The climate scenarios that the media almost always use rarely 
disclose that calculations include these ‘negative emissions’. This distortion can be traced by the UN 
 
90 “Climate change: Promises will mean rise of 2.4C – study” (May 4th, 2021, Roger Harrabin).  
91 Even if it were to exist, such projects would suffer from the usual objections of NIMBY (Not In My BackYard)
