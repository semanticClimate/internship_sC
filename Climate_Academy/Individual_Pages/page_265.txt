the crisis is so pathetically limp - a loud, piercing noise has to be made. Things need to be shaken up. 
Decades of calm measured warnings from the scientific community have been ignored. There is a 
moment at which you simply have to make things uncomfortable and just push the truth into a place 
where everyone has to look at it.  
Let’s be specific about this tepid climate coverage. Let’s kick aside the broad descriptions of the 
mismatch between our general level of climate awareness and zoom in on one tiny example. Before 
I go any further, you might want to sit down. This is because the example at hand is so excruciatingly 
bad.  
Here it is. It makes me angry.  
Get ready for some serious cognitive dissonance.  
Today is July 29th, 2022. I am in Turin for the Fridays For Future (FFF) European Summer Camp (to 
help give a workshop on Climate Education). It is sizzling hot. In fact, it has been a summer of 
unprecedented heatwaves, droughts and forest fires, across large swathes of Europe. 
Notwithstanding all the other recent scientific reports that vividly illustrate just how much 
destabilization of the Earth Systems is taking place, these heatwaves have provided a strong 
reminder of the dangers ahead. In the midst of this crisis, in the searing heat that might just help us 
grasp our predicament with greater clarity, the BBC put this story as the main news headline on their 
Homepage this evening.
