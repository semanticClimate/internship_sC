need to do is cut emissions by 36% for 1.5°C and 11% for 2°C. In the case of Sweden, it has pledged 
to cut emissions by 2.1% per year from now, but it will need to do 24% for 1.5°C and 7.4% for 2°C.   
 
And so on.   
 
It is only when a proper measure is held up that we can get any true sense of how well a nation is 
performing. These numbers expose how slack the media coverage is. The gap between the current 
pledges and the action required for 1.5°C is so improbably wide it makes a nonsense of any talk of 
“ambitious pledges”.  
 
Furthermore, for all the sense of progress with the climate crisis that comes with each new round of 
pledges, the trends for emissions since 1992 have been upwards. For example, the top five  
developed nations of the world have increased their emissions on a 25 year trend (Norway +0.6%, 
Ireland +0.2%, Switzerland +1.4%, and Hong Kong +0.5%).203    
 
Finally, as established in Chapter 3, “Spaceship Earth”, the cause of the elevated emissions is rooted 
in the resource extraction figures. It is informative to remember the (unsurprisingly) close 
correspondence between the two sets of figures. For example, the heaviest emitting nation in the 
world is Luxembourg (cut 38% per year from now for 2°C), and it is also the hungriest extractor of 
resources (104 tonnes per year, trending upwards at +3.5% over a 25-year period).204  
 
Although at surface level, the lifestyles of the UHD might look clean and advanced, a proper look 
down the chain of consumption shows dirty, destructive reality. If every human emitted as UHD, 
global CO2 emissions would triple overnight, with immediate catastrophic consequences. 
 
The VHD, HD, MD and LD nations  
The Very High Developed (VHD) nations, with on average 8.7 tonnes of CO2 emissions per capita, 
need to make average annual cuts of 9% per year from 2022. There is wide variation in emissions in 
the VHD group, with for example 45th ranked Qatar needing to reduce 32% per year, 46th ranked 
Argentina only 4.4% per year, and 52nd ranked Russia 10% per year. 
The High Developed (HD) nations need to make average annual cuts of 5.2% per year from 2022.205 
Ranked 85th in the United Nations Human Development Index, China is the biggest emitter of 
greenhouse gases in the world, with 1.4 billion people. However, its consumption emissions are 6.5 
tonnes CO2 per person, which is exactly half that of the UHD average (13 tonnes CO2 per person), and 
about one third of USAs 18 tonnes / cap. Whilst they are a world leading investor in green technology, 
they are still heavily reliant on coal to meet their energy demands. For China to play its role in a world 
that holds temperatures below 2°C it would need to cut its emissions by 6.9% per year from now.  
The Medium Developed (MD) countries need to make annual reductions of -0.9% on average. India 
(-1.7%) with almost 1.4 billion inhabitants, is the most significant nation in this group. The modest 
lifestyles of India’s huge population means that their per capita emissions are low, at 1.7 tonnes CO2 
per capita. However, if India would follow the same path as the UHD nations into a very high

possible to harvest specific data for the city as Special Administrative Region of China.    
204 As a reminder, the scientific authority on natural resources (IRP) has concluded that for sustainable 
development, the average person can consume seven tonnes of the Earth’s resources per year by 2050.

social development” (2014).
