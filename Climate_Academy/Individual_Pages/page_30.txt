(especially since 1950), we have booted the climate into unchartered territory.  The level of CO2 has 
been entrenched in a stable range of between ~180ppm and ~280ppm for well over a million years.19 
Therefore, a reading of over 420 ppm is not a historic level; it is a profoundly prehistoric level. 
Throwing our whole ecological system out of its long-entrenched equilibrium is unimaginably foolish. 
The entire biosphere that we are part of has evolved over millions of years into forms of life that are 
perfectly adapted to this current environment. Anthropogenic climate change is happening at breath-
taking speed, 0.2°C per decade, and it is accelerating.20 There might be more solar panels and wind 
turbines around, but do not be misled, our booming population and consumption is driving emissions 
faster and faster. We have not slowed anything down yet. Overall, the speed we are travelling at is 
about 20 times faster than the average rate of ice-age recovery warming.21  We have already driven 
ourselves into a minefield of dangers, and not yet found the brake pedal.

20 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018) Executive Summary  
21 Nasa Earth Observatory: “As the Earth moved out of ice ages over the past million years, the global temperature rose a 
total of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius over about 5,000 years.” That is about 0.008 to 0.014°C per decade; in other words, current 
climate change is 14 to 25 (average 20) times faster than the average rate of ice-recovery warming.
