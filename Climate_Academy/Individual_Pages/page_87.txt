However, the fundamental question about climate change remains unstated and unanswered.  
The essential target for humans is buried far away from the home page. The essential data that 
demonstrates our progress towards that target is startling by its omission. It is a systemic problem 
that extends from the webpage to the podium. It is a systemic problem that is also mirrored in the 
way the media reports on the UNFCCC.  
Pointing back to previous warnings about “cropping” the public space, the foggy media coverage can 
be quickly understood. How many media networks have a deep enough motivation to get to expose 
the truth behind those statements? The commercial imperative to appear interesting and attract clicks 
is normally stronger than the imperative to present the difficult truth.

There are two issues here.

Clarity 
Firstly, returning to the problem of reporting emissions targets as percentages: imagine that as a 
parent you receive a report for your child which reads like this: “In History, we expect Madeline to 
achieve a 26- 28% improvement in her grade by 2025 based on the results she attained in 2005” and 
“In Geography, we expect Madeline to increase her mark by 40% by 2040 based on the level of 1990”.  
Given such a foggy and muddled format, you would rightly insist that the school provide another 
document. It would be reasonable to ask for the overview to be given in grades like 7/10 and 8/10. It 
is a notation system that is transparent, and it enables the reader to draw the main conclusions easily. 
They show where improvements have been made, and where more effort or interventions are 
needed.  
Every child in a class has the right to know how well they are performing, for better or worse. Every 
citizen has the right to clear information about the atmosphere.
