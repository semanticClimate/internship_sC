The savage ending to this formidable storm of human history is a bit of a toe curler, and any student 
of the French Revolution knows where all this is going to end up.  
  
After centuries of encrusted Feudal rule, the nobles of the ancien regime will be thrown out of 
power in a sudden swirl of events. King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette, along with thousands 
of others, will be beheaded.112 The hands held aloft in unity here would soon turn into a frenzy of 
finger pointing and paranoia.113 ‘The Reign of Terror’ would surge through France as a horrendously 
violent storm in 1793-4, in a fulfilment of du Pan's prediction that "the Revolution would devour its 
own children”. 
 
What started out as an outward looking vision to unite the nation of France under some noble 
enlightenment principles ended up pivoting into a destructive, psychotic turn inwards. The leaders of 
the Revolution, along with their groupies, pulled down the symbolic order, shredded the rule book, 
the calendar, and anything that threatened their evangelistic progress towards a perfect society. 
What started as inclusive ended up as convulsive.  
 
And it all concluded with a sweeping violation of the very thing that it set out to establish - human 
rights.  
 
In fact, David actually had a very good excuse for not colouring his sketch of the Tennis Court Oath 
in. By the time his background drawings were complete, the men in the picture had got caught up in 
the blood bath. On 12th November 1793, at the Champ de Mars, the busy blade of a guillotine would 
slice off Bailly’s head.   
 
Woosh 
 
You probably didn’t see that coming Monsieur Bailly. 
 
 
112 Being beheaded really does make it difficult “to eat cake”.

David’s painting in the BBC documentary, “The Power of Art”.
