Introduction 
 
The Velodrome 
Indoor track cycling. What a sport.  
The Olympian demands that the athletes push themselves through on the track are astonishing. Any 
win in such an event takes a cyclist to the limits of what a human being can exert and endure.  
It is also a sport that has witnessed some truly memorable crashes, especially in the team events. If 
you are brave enough to look through the gaps in your fingers at a YouTube compilation of velodrome 
crashes, you will see a truly horrendous combination of Lycra, speed, metal and wood.  
Thankfully, such carnage is not that common. The cyclists are able to sustain speeds of over 80kmh 
whilst jockeying to gain small pockets of slipstream with incredible skill and concentration. However, 
when a crash does happen, the fine margins that the athletes trade in whilst hurtling around the track, 
look awfully thin.   
A pile-up often starts with a tiny wobble or a small miscalculation. However, because there is so 
much kinetic energy packed into a compact space, the effects of these small moments of imbalance 
have major consequences. One rider can trigger a chain reaction that can send numerous bikes and 
bodies flying into the air.
