Conclusion 
This student guidebook started with these trees.  
 
From the outside, the climate crisis just looks a bit banal. Something about things getting hotter; 
something about more individual storms, droughts and floods; something about doing more 
individual actions to make things better. Many students feel lethargic or disconnected from the 
issues because they have never had their understanding advanced further than a fragmented, 
primary school level of awareness. It is therefore unsurprising to find a parallel in many student’s 
casual civic response to the situation.  
Hopefully, these last 15 chapters have put the reader in the best seat to make things clear.  
 
A systems perspective does not 
deny all the details.  
It gives the details a coherence 
and clarity.  
This basic map of the 
boundaries is what is missing in 
our schools. This basic view of 
the essentials is what is missing 
in the media and our public 
discourse about the crisis.
