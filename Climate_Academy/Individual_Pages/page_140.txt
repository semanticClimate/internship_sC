Indeed, across the immense Boreal forests of the Northern hemisphere, there were widespread 
reports of unprecedented heatwaves, electrical storms and large-scale forest fires. The Boreal forests 
are one of the major cogs of the Earth’s climate system, and in 2018 they were experiencing 
unprecedented heat stress.223  
2019 was also characterized by similar extreme weather patterns. Indeed, NOAA reported that June 
2019 was officially the hottest June on record for the globe. For Anchorage (in Alaska, USA), it was 
0.95°C above the average,224 and the citizens of that city also experienced a string of astonishingly hot 
days at the start of July 2019 that were 12.4°C above the average.225 For various reasons of thermal 
dynamics, global warming is not happening at uniform speeds across the globe and Alaska is among 
the fastest warming regions on the planet226227. Since the start of the Industrial revolution, it has 
heated up by an average 2.7°C. In 2019, the WMO reported that: “Since the start of June, the 
Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) has tracked over 100 intense and long-lived 
wildfires in the Arctic Circle. In June alone, these fires emitted 50 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into 
the atmosphere, which is equivalent to Sweden’s total annual emissions. This is more than was 
released by Arctic fires in the same month between 2010 and 2018 combined.”228  
To the East, at the same latitude, Siberia had experienced similar wild temperatures and wildfires, and 
in July 2019 an area totalling the size of Belgium was ablaze. 
The lack of photosynthesis by the side of a motorway is of course not significant at a global level. 
However, the lack of photosynthesis on such a monumental scale in the vast Boreal forests of the 
Northern hemisphere would have had a critical knock-on effect. It means that going forward into the 
future, there is an increased chance of more heatwaves and droughts. In turn, this means a higher 
probability of more wilted trees, forest fires and scorched earth – all of which pushes up the level of 
CO2 in the atmosphere even higher… and so on.  
The “and so on” is very important.  
Destabilising such large components of the Earth’s systems into self-reinforcing feedback loops like 
this poses the biggest risk of all – a triggering of irreversible, cascading impacts. In the end, the scale 
of the dynamics become so magnified that the natural forces in play simply reduce human efforts to 
mitigate the problem ineffective. It simply doesn’t matter how many trees (puny) little humans want 
to plant, if the land and climate around us is trapped into a spiral of radical, inhospitable imbalance.   
The example of the Boreal forests tipping into a different state “at 3°C” raises some important 
technical issues about the science of tipping points that must now be addressed.  
A map of what lies ahead 
If all the pixels of scientific research are put together, it becomes possible to form an overall picture 
of the future scenarios ahead. Of course, the moment that we zoom out to a very general level of 
summary, so many nuances and qualifications in the original research papers get lost. However, these 
wider vantage points are important.
