It does not need a meteorite strike or massive volcanic activity to throw the planet into an entirely 
different mode of operation; ask the tiny cyanobacteria. Small things can have a huge impact, ask 
anyone with a peanut allergy. We were never a match in size for the biggest mammals, but our 
diminutive size has been made irrelevant by the force of our technological power and by the sheer 
magnitude of our number. Not only is the human population just a few small steps away from 
reaching 8 billion, but if you count humans and add all the animals that we own, then we account for 
an astonishing 96% of the entire mammal biomass of the world.39 Or maybe, once we are long gone 
from the Earth, it will be our mechanical control of the avian world that will be our lasting mark? The 
bones of the 50 billion chickens that we consume every year could end up as our permanent 
signature in the crust of the planet.  
 
Whichever direction you look, something really big is going on. So big in fact that Geologists have 
now proposed that a slice of deep Earth time should be named after us: “The Anthropocene”.  
 
Questions 
 
1. What age do you think children should be taught about Mass Extinction Events?  
2. Geologists will take decades to formalise the end of the Holocene and the start of the 
Anthropocene. James Watt’s invention of the steam engine in 1784 was proposed as most 
appropriate starting point. What date or invention would you propose?
