Once the systemic threat to us becomes widely known and accepted, then every major weather 
event will drive home the point. Given how dumb it is to push the entire natural world into a hostile

the soul singer Sam Cooke sang so memorably before his 
murder in 1964, “A Change is Gonna Come”.  
 
 
Questions 
•

climate crisis today for the country that you live in?  
• 
What types of climate change denial still exist? 
• 
Is “net zero” the new type of denialism?
