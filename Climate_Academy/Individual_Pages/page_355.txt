With this quintuple helix framework in place, this concluding chapter, will finish by zooming in on 
two key features of Plato’s vision for The Philosopher Kings and Queens. Firstly, the importance of 
leadership that is rooted in virtues. Secondly, the importance of rational laws. 
These two things cut across all of these things and are in line with the holism that the chapter 
started with. The reason for indulging all the details about the holistic nature of the learning in 
Plato’s Academy in the opening section was due to the importance of this completeness for a 
conclusion.  
Plato’s Academy was founded on a love of the truth and a commitment to beauty and values. And it 
was founded in anticipation that these virtues would enable the graduates of The Academy to 
legislate with reason and justice.  
Virtuous Leadership  
In recognition of the fact that the climate crisis demands that education steps up a gear, the Joint 
Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission published an important document, “The 
European Sustainability Competence Framework” (2022); or “GreenComp”, for short.441  
The ‘GreenComp’ picks out 12 key skills.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Climate Academy certificates have been designed with these competences wired into their 
structure. All of the skills are covered, but the ones underlined in green are those which are rarely 
developed in secondary school environmental education.
