It was not just the dinosaurs who had a bad day; the bolide strike ended up wiping out an estimated 
75% of all life on Earth. Who could really argue with a blast as strong as ~2 million thermonuclear Tsar 
Bombs?29 Indeed, a group of fish found in North Dakota certainly did not get time to say much in 
response. Their fossilised remains were found in 2012; they had been caught with their mouths open 
and with tiny glass beads from the blast site lodged in their gills.30 Who could blame them for gawping 
at bit? They must have been rather shocked to see a mega-tsunami, 100 metres tall, coming towards 
them.31 
It took humans quite some time to spot the cause of this fifth extinction event: the Mexican crater 
where the bolide struck. Paradoxically, this is because the crater is so big - you need a plane to notice 
that it is there.32 It is the Chicxulub crater, and the ring of the dent is 180 kilometres wide.33 Half on 
land, half in the sea, it was detected from the air in 1978.  The shocked quartz and highly unusual 
levels of iridium (Ir) at the site confirm to geologists that something truly cosmic34 had happened.  
Which brings us to the sixth wipe-out, today.  
 
We are in the middle of a Mass Extinction Event. It is right under our noses. But again, with a bit of 
paradox, although it is happening now, it is such a big event it is hard to see it. If we were to read 
one research paper (for example, on biodiversity loss) and have it pinned up on a wall alongside all 
the other studies and data that confirm our invasive impact on the planet, then that wall would 
stretch for miles and miles in both directions. Many of the graphs on this wall would look like 
‘hockey sticks’ as the current destruction has accelerated exponentially since 1950 – something 
often referred to as “The Great Acceleration”35.  
 
Rather appropriately, this image put humans in the middle of it all. As George Monbiot helpfully 
qualifies, “Let’s stop calling this the Sixth Great Extinction. Let’s start calling it what it is: the “first 
great extermination” … describing the current eradication of living systems (including human 
societies) as an extinction event makes this catastrophe sound like a passive accident”.36 
 
To be very correct, a 75% wipe-out is normally required to qualify for a mass extinction.37 But there 
is not much need to worry about reaching this high bar – we are doing our very best to reduce the 
natural world down to a domestic collection of cows and pigs, cats and dogs, at an extinction rate 
that is 100-1000 times the ‘prehuman’ or ‘background’ rate.38 Indeed, if you then add on top the 
deep stress caused by climate change which wild animals have no facility or time to adapt to, we are 
pretty much guaranteed to get the three-quarters mark soon enough.

yottajoules of energy. cf. Durand-Manterola, H. J.; Cordero-Tercero, G. (2014). “Assessments of the energy, mass and size

Mexico, by geophysicists Glen Penfield and Antonio Camargo.

34 Iridium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth’s crust, it is found in great abundance in meteorites. The spike in 
iridium levels at the K-Pg boundary is important evidence in support of the Alvarez hypothesis that a space rock, roughly 
the size of Mount Everest, smashed into our planet.
