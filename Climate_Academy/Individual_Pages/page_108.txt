weather events.172 At a more general level, two thirds of the country lies less than 4.5meters above 
sea level and a third of the population lives by the coast – very fine margins, even with an optimistic 
take on sea level rise projections. Just a 50cm rise would displace an estimated 18million people and 
eliminate about 11% of the land173; and this is just the thin-end of the wedge, “Scientific American” 
dares to glance forward to more negative scenarios which would trigger the largest migration in 
human history of 50million people.174   
As a prelude to these giant impacts, major shifts are already underway. Water salinity has increased 
by 26% in the last 35 years, the effects of which can be observed in aspects of Bangladeshi life as 
diverse as miscarriage rates, agricultural and fishery yields, and compromised drinking water.175   
As a reminder, the UK needs to reduce its emissions by 27%pa for 1.5°C and 8.1%pa for the 2°C limit. 
By contrast, Bangladesh only needs to reduce their emissions by 2.4%pa, and for 1.5°C they could 
even increase their emissions by 0.5%pa for 2°C. These numbers are even more difficult to accept 
when the extreme vulnerability of Bangladesh to sea level rises is considered.176

Many people think that by cutting taxes for the rich, the extra wealth that is created drips down to 
the poor people in an economy. It is called ‘trickle-down economics’. It is a nice idea. But it doesn’t 
happen. In fact, ‘trickle-down economics’ could be called a ‘zombie idea’177 – an oddly persistent 
idea that hangs around in the public imagination despite it being dead. Indeed, the Nobel Laureate 
economist Joseph Stiglitz insisted that there is no evidence for wealth ‘trickling down’ from the rich 
to the poor in economic history;178 a finding confirmed by numerous other papers.179 More crudely 
and more to the point, Damien O’Connor (an MP from New Zealand) called “trickle-down 
economics”, “the rich pissing on the poor”.  
It is a zombie idea with a long running history. Mike Davis asks a well pointed question in his book 
“Late Victorian Holocausts” (2000), “How do we weigh smug claims about the life saving benefits of

176 Indeed, even today the increased salination of fresh water supplies in Bangladesh has triggered a significant 
spike in the number of miscarriages suffered by pregnant Bangladeshi women. Between 2012 and 2017, the 
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) scientists registered 12,867 
pregnancies in the coastal area and they found that women, living within 20 km of the coastline and 7m above 
sea level were 1.3 times more likely to miscarry and face other health hazards than women who live inland.
