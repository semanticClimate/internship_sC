If we imagine these as empty buckets, we now need to know how quickly they are being filled up. The 
answer is that humans are currently emitting about 42 gigatonnes of greenhouses gases per year. 
Which might look like this:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Doing some quick mathematics, it is clear that we have just a bit over 2 years before the budget for 
1.5°C is used up, and around 16 years before we hit the limit for 2°C warming88.  
If we take the Paris Agreement at face value and assume that all of the nations of the world actually 
want to limit climate change to well below 2°C, then this carbon budget would be the starting point 
and the end point of the commitments and the negotiations that follow.  
 
The bottom line is as simple as this. And the powerful work of Michael Wadleigh and Birgit van 
Munster enables us to see these budgets diminishing in real time with something that they created 
and named, “The Gigaclock”. When all the data is assembled into one place and all the scientific co-
ordinates given, the remaining budgets can be seen moving towards zero at the current/right speed.    
 
88 At 87% probability. See CUTx Chapter for further details.
