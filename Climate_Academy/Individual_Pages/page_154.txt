MAIN TEXT 
On Paradigm shifts 
When to move on?  
After these two contrasting case studies, an important set of questions now presents itself.  
In the case of Kate, it was important to give up a belief.  
In the case of Newton, it was important to hold onto it.  
So, at what point should we allow a relationship to fail? When should we pull the plug on a pattern 
of behaviour? How long should we try and protect a world view? When does it become unhealthy to 
carry on inside an old system of thinking?  
The truth is that it is very difficult to know. Without a divine view of things, we must make our 
judgements based on the evidence at hand. Knowing when to make a break with a belief or a 
commitment is problematic. Moreover, once it is clear that it is time to move on, it can then be 
difficult to actually move on.  
The dynamics of messy personal relationships are worth a little more attention, because it will 
expose a key feature of how complex systems of belief operate: we turn again to tipping points. In 
the case of complex systems of belief, a tipping point is the moment when one paradigm of beliefs 
collapses, and a space opens up for a new one to emerge.   
This the first appearance of the word “paradigm” in this chapter – and it signals the direction that we 
are going in.  
Getting stuck  
Most clearly, in the case of an abusive relationship it is evident from an outsider’s standpoint that 
we should just get out. Yet, the tragedy is that the dynamics of power in such a situation normally 
stall that crucial decision for far too long.
