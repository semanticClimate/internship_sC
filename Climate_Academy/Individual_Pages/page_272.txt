Main Text 
… and so to our writers.  
First, a poet.  
Lord Alfred Tennyson (1809-1992) 
“Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers”.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Don’t worry. We have not just dropped the 5 stages of grief.  
Kubler-Ross identifies stage 4 as “depression”; and stage 5, the final 
stage, as “acceptance”. 
In his groundbreaking poem, “In Memoriam” (1850) we find Tennyson trying to rock himself forward 
in the lines of his verse, from depression to acceptance. This is because it is a poem about the death 
of his beloved friend, Alfred H. Hallam – who died, aged just 22. In fact, the full title of the poem is 
“In Memoriam A.H.H.”.  
Tennyson doesn’t find closure.  
However, the artistry of the attempt is so powerful, that many thousands of people have since found 
solace and recognition through his text. Not least, Queen Victoria who had lost her beloved Prince 
Albert early in her reign. She was “much soothed” by his lines, and next to the Bible, always kept a 
copy on her desk. Quoting the famous last line of the poem, she wrote in her journal, “Tis better to 
have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.”  
“In Memoriam” is clearly a poem about personal grief. However, it appears here in this Climate 
Academy guidebook because of the wider social context that was in play with Tennyson. At the time 
of writing, Victorian England was struggling with the fall out of some major advances in science that 
had revealed the natural world to be shockingly, profoundly different to what everyone had 
assumed for millennia. It is therefore a poem about private loss, and at the same time, it is handling 
the wider insecurities, loss, and alarm that had dramatically opened up in the culture of his time.
