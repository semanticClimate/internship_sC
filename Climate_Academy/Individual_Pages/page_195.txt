Figure 36, Trojan Horse, from GreekBoston.com. 
The storyline of the Trojan Horse is well known. 
However, there is one detail that is often overlooked. 
Cassandra 
Look more closely at the moment the wooden horse is being dragged towards the city. As the men 
heave on the ropes and the horse edges closer to the city walls there is a woman in the crowd 
shouting out the alarm. She is clearly and explicitly warning the Trojans of an armed force inside the 
gift. This woman knows what will happen next, the problem is that no-one will listen to her. 
The woman shouting out the warnings was the beautiful Cassandra. She was gorgeous but cursed. 
Greek epic literature tells of how her curvaceous body and long brown hair wins the attention of the 
God Apollo, who in exchange for sex, promises to endow her with the gift of prophecy. However, 
after Cassandra reneges on her side of the deal, Apollo takes his revenge in a particularly bitter way. 
He spits in her mouth. This does not remove the gift of prophecy. With a particular kind of cruelty, 
however, it ensures that no one will ever believe her. 
Not being able to hear the truth about the future had devastating consequences for the Trojans. If 
only they could have listened. 
In 2021, predicting the future is no longer the gift of the gods to prophetesses or mystics, we do not 
rely on hazy readings of omens or portents anymore, modern science has developed the power to 
reliably foresee the future through observation and reason.
