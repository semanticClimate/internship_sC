by the intellect. It requires courage to think outside of our normal boundaries. Within an individual, 
just like within society, there is often a fight for control over what is permitted to be known.  
Conclusion 
The situation we are in demands that we become fully human. We need to think and act beyond just 
our basic instincts and sensibilities. Indeed, there is a major upside to the climate crisis: it will force us 
to be our true selves. A full response to climate change will make us deeply human. We are 
wonderfully, beautifully, multi-dimensional creatures. The transformation of human society ahead will 
either be catastrophic or simply wonderful. Either way, it will not happen without struggle.
