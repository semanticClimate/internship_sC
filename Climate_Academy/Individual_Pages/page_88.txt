Answering the Question 
Secondly, many students who fail an exam or an assessment do so because they do not answer the 
question.  
When appropriate, my Philosophy students’ essays are assessed on a ‘shit’ scale. At the bottom of this 
scale is horseshit. These responses are characterised by various features: they cover a large area, they 
have little shape but a large volume, they don’t really smell of anything because their content is rather 
bland, they are not very memorable – and crucially, they don’t answer the question.  
Although it is a very unpleasant thought, at the top of the scale is dogshit. These are outstanding 
essays, characterised by a very meaty content, a compact size and a strong impression that is difficult 
to forget. Most importantly, dogshit essays point somewhere.  
If I invited my students to assess any of the speeches made in all of the COP meetings, or indeed any 
political comments about climate change, they would be graded as horseshit. They simply do not 
answer the question that they have set out to answer.  
 
Although teachers can monotonously repeat the same message about focus, and although many 
students struggle to see why this is so fundamentally important in an assessment, the dull fact is that 
not answering the question posed makes all of the knowledge and understanding they might have 
used irrelevant.  
 
The UN has one job to do:  
 
Namely: “stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which would 
prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system”.  
 
In all the clutter of statements, initiatives, meetings, tweets, articles, press releases and media 
coverage – they have not been held to account over this one singular task.
