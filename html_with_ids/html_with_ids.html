<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<div>
        Forty-five percent of the world’s forested areas are in the tropics,
        and they are among the most important regulators of regional and
        global climate, natural carbon sinks and the most significant
        repositories of terrestrial biomass. They are of immeasurable value
        to biodiversity, ecosystem services, social and cultural identities,
        livelihoods, and climate change adaptation and mitigation.
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.2.1; CCP7.2.2; Box CCP7.2; Table CCP7.2 } Climate change is
        altering the structure and species composition of tropical tree
        communities ( ), including transitions from moist to drier forest in
        regions such as the Amazon ( ), and movement of species from lower
        to higher elevations ( ). Despite CO fertilisation, ongoing climate
        change has weakened the carbon sink potential of tropical forests in
        Amazonia and, to a lesser extent, in Africa and Asia ( ).
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.2.3; CCP7.3 } Deforestation generally reduces rainfall and
        enhances temperatures, with effects depending on scales ( ), while
        often increasing surface runoff ( ). Continued deforestation-driven
        landscape drying and fragmentation will aggravate fire risk and
        reduce forest resilience, leading to degradation or savannisation of
        the tropical forest biomes, in particular in combination with
        climate change ( ).
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.3.6} Adaptation of tropical forests to climate change provides
        an opportunity for tropical countries to develop forest policies
        that create incentives for environmental services such as carbon
        storage and biodiversity refugia. Forest restoration using a diverse
        mix of native species can help rebuild the climate resilience of
        tropical forests, but is best implemented alongside other
        sustainable forest management strategies and adaptation
        interventions ( e).
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.5; Box CCP7.1 } For successful adaptation of tropical forest
        communities, it is vital to consider IK and LK in addition to modern
        scientific approaches, together with consideration of non-climatic
        vulnerabilities (e.g., poverty, gender inequality and power
        asymmetries) ( ). Climate change vulnerability and adaptive capacity
        have a historical and geopolitical context, conditioned by value
        systems and development models. Transformative and sustainable
        practices are required for effective management of tropical forests
        ( ).
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.4; Box CCP7.1 } Tropical deforestation is largely driven by
        agriculture, both from subsistence farming and industrial
        agriculture (e.g., oil palm, timber plantations, soybeans,
        livestock) ( ). While poverty and population growth combined with
        poor governance often fuel subsistence agriculture ( ), industrial
        agriculture is often driven by international market forces for
        commodities and large-scale land acquisitions ( ).
        <!-- -->
        {CCP7.2.3} Transformative levers towards improving environmental
        governance and resilience of tropical forests include: incentivising
        and building capacity for environmental responsibility and
        discontinuing harmful subsidies and disincentives; reforming
        segmented decision-making to promote integration across sectors and
        jurisdictions; pursuing pre-emptive and precautionary actions;
        managing for resilient social and ecological systems in the face of
        uncertainty and complexity; strengthening environmental laws and
        policies and their implementation; acknowledging land tenure and
        rights; and inclusive stakeholder participation (medium confidence).

<h1>CCP7.1 Introduction</h1> 
      
        Climate change is already impacting tropical forests around the
        world, including through distributional shifts of forest biomes,
        changes in species composition, biomass, pests and diseases, and
        increases in forest fires ( ). These impacts are often compounded by
        non-climatic factors such as conversion of land for other uses,
        burning to clear land, mining, and road and infrastructure
        development. It is notable that, despite societal awareness and
        financial opportunities to restore forests ( ), tropical forests are
        increasingly threatened. For instance, the conversion of tropical
        forests to large-scale agricultural production (mainly soybeans, oil
        palm, maize, cotton, livestock), is among the strongest drivers of
        species richness decline of both flora and fauna, thereby impacting
        the adaptation opportunities of ecosystems and local people to
        climate change ( ). Reducing direct and indirect drivers of
        deforestation and forest degradation is therefore critical to
        building, maintaining or enhancing the resilience of tropical
        forests against climate and non-climate drivers alike ( ). With
        climate change-related drivers becoming increasingly important in
        the future, changes to tropical forests will most be aggravated
        overall, although some tropical forests may temporarily benefit,
        physiologically, from higher temperatures and changes in
        precipitation patterns. To the degree to which forests are affected
        by climate change and other drivers, their resilience against these
        stressors is diminishing leading to a reduction in the regulating,
        supporting, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services they
        provide ( ; Cadman et al., 2017; Pörtner et al., 2021) (Chapter 2) (
        ). This, in turn, is affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions
        of people who depend on forests and their products, in particular
        forest dwelling communities, but also, via the teleconnections
        between forests and surrounding areas of influence, in
        socio-ecological systems outside the forests themselves. While
        strong mitigation efforts are fundamental to minimising future
        climate impacts on forests, forest management can be improved in
        many places in support of enhancing the resilience of tropical
        forests, often with significant co-benefits for carbon storage,
        biodiversity, food security and ecosystem services ( ). Sustainable
        management practices allow forests to be utilised, frequently with
        equally high or even higher productivity levels, while keeping their
        core functions intact. While there are numerous approaches to
        managing forests and forest landscapes sustainably, an element that
        appears to be critical is property rights and tenure arrangements
        allowing stewards of the land, including Indigenous Peoples,
        securing long-term access and utilisation of forest resources ( ) (
        ; Naughton-Treves, 2014). Figure CCP7.1 illustrates the
        interconnections of climate risks and non-climate drivers facing
        tropical forests. On the one hand, the rates and extent of
        deforestation and forest degradation result in loss of ecosystem
        services, biodiversity and human well-being and enhance the
        vulnerability of the social-ecological system to the impacts of
        climate change. On the other, forest protection and sustainable
        forest management result in higher resilience of the ecosystem
        against climate impacts. This framing illustrates both the
        complexity and scale of the challenge and provides opportunities to
        reduce impacts at different scales by eliminating the underlying
        drivers, both climate and non-climate related, through policies and
        measures at global, national and subnational levels, involving state
        and non-state actors alike.

        Good forest governance would increase the resilience of tropical
        forest through better adaptation to and mitigation of climate change
        (right side). Building on what has been presented in IPCC AR5, SR15
        and SRCCL, Section CCP7.2 first briefly describes the types and
        extent of tropical forest ecosystems, and then looks at current
        rates and drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Section
        CCP7.3 presents current and projected climate change impacts on
        tropical trees and forests, focusing primarily on drought, heat and
        fires, looking from physiological responses to risks, projected
        climate change impact and forest resilience. Section CCP7.4
        addresses the impacts of climate change and tropical forest
        destruction on the livelihoods and well-being of communities and
        peoples living in or being strongly dependent upon tropical forests.
        This section includes a Box on Indigenous knowledge and local
        knowledge and community-based adaptation. Section CCP7.5 assesses
        adaptation options for the sustainable management of tropical
        forests drawing upon the protection, management and restoration
        framework, and includes a Box on the connection between sustainable
        forest management and the United Nations Sustainable Development
        Goals. Section CCP7.6, finally, assesses opportunities and
        challenges of tropical forest governance to maintain and enhance
        resilience against climate change impacts on forests.

<h1>CCP7.2 The Current State of Tropical Forests</h1>
      In the most recent Global Ecological Zones map produced by the Food and
            Agriculture Organization (FAO) for the year 2010, tropical vegetation
            has been defined as encompassing regions which are frost-free during all
            months in the year ( ). Further, the tropical vegetation has been
            sub-classified into tropical rainforest, tropical moist forest, tropical
            dry forest, tropical shrubland, tropical desert and tropical mountain
            systems based on climate in combination with vegetation physiognomy and
            orographic zone (Table SMCCP7.1). IPCC has used the basic FAO
            classification in its National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Guidelines (
            ). Since the FAO ecological zones represent potential biome extents, the
            present area under forest is assessed using the European Space Agency
            Climate Change Initiative Land Cover data set ( ). The ESA data set
            provides a direct mapping to IPCC land categories (e.g., ‘forest’),
            allowing for standardised and consistent reporting of existing forest
            and forest gain/loss in each ecological zone. The most extensive
            tropical ecological zone is the tropical rainforest (1459 Mha or about
            25% of all tropical ecological zones), followed by tropical desert
            (which is not further considered here), tropical moist forest, tropical
            shrubland, tropical dry forest and tropical mountain system (Table
            CCP7.1; Figure CCP7.2). Mangroves are not explicitly considered in the
            FAO classification. Tropical rainforest occurs largely in South America,
            Africa, and South and Southeast Asia, and is the most intact tropical
            forest biome (Table CCP7.1). Significant portions of tropical moist
            forest, which abut tropical rainforest in many regions but experience a
            longer dry season, have been lost in most regions (Table CCP7.2).
            Tropical moist forest typically grades into the highly threatened
            tropical dry forest ecological zone, of which only about a third exists
            under forest cover at present. Only about 44% of tropical mountain
            systems, which occur approximately above 1000 m above mean sea level,
            are presently under forest cover. While the FAO classification provides
            the potential tropical ecological zones (roughly, ‘vegetation types’),
            there are large differences in the extents of global tropical forest
            biomes which are still remaining as reported by different sources (Sayre
            et al., 2020; Ocón et al., 2021). These differences result from
            differences in biome definition, data source, the definition of
            ‘forest’, and the method used for classifying remotely sensed data. For
            example, the reported global area of tropical dry forests ranges from
            105 to 645 Mha (Pan et al., 2013; Bastin et al., 2017; Ocón et al.,
            2021).

<h3>CCP7.2.1 Distribution and Biodiversity of Tropical Forest Ecosystems</h3>
              Tropical forests are indisputably the areas with highest biological
                diversity on Earth, both in absolute and density (species per area)
                terms (Plotkin et al., 2000). Estimates account that tropical forests
                harbour half or even more of world’s biodiversity (Kier et al., 2009;
                Jenkins et al., 2013), even though this figure is highly uncertain
                owing to varying estimates of undescribed species (Mora et al., 2011).
                For example, it is estimated that there are at least 40,000, but
                possibly more than 53,000 tree species in tropical forests (Slik et
                al., 2015). A vast majority of this biodiversity and Indigenous
                knowledge and local knowledge associated with its use remains poorly
                explored, presenting a vast unlocked genetic reserve at risk of loss,
                although many of today’s important medicines, foods and ecosystem
                products originate from tropical forests ( ; Calderon et al., 2009, ).
                Rates of global biodiversity loss in the past few decades have
                acelerated to levels that are, for some taxa, approaching the
                estimated rate of 75% of taxa extinction found in Earth’s ‘big five’
                mass extinction events (Barnosky et al., 2011; Díaz et al., 2019; ).
                Even though species–area relationships tend to overestimate extinction
                rates ( ), there is evidence that species richness in tropical forests
                is alarmingly approaching or surpassing the taxa extinction value in
                this period (45% for dung beetles, 51% for lizards, 65% for ants, and
                80% for mammals) should deforestation and habitat loss continue at the
                current pace ( ; Ceballos et al., 2017). Moreover, there is reasonable
                understanding that these numbers are underestimated and, as such,
                tropical forest loss and degradation alone will precipitate a sixth
                mass extinction event ( ). A total of 13 out of the 25 global
                biodiversity hotspots for conservation are located in tropical
                forests, such as Brazil’s Atlantic Forest and India’s Western
                Ghats/Sri Lanka (Myers et al., 2000). While forest loss and
                degradation have been the main cause of tropical biodiversity loss in
                the past, climate change now arises as a major threat not only for
                individual tropical forest species or taxa—as already observed for
                frogs (Pounds et al., 2006)—but for whole communities
                (Esquivel-Muelbert et al., 2019), and even entire tropical forest
                ecoregions (Lapola et al., 2018).

<h3>CCP7.2.2 Rates of Deforestation, Tropical Reforestation and Connections
                  to Climate Resilience of Tropical Forests</h3>
    
             More than 420 million ha of forest were lost globally in the
             1990–2020 period because of deforestation, and more than 90% of that
             loss took place in tropical areas ( ). For the 2015–2020 period, the
             tropical deforestation rate decreased compared with 2010–2015, being
             estimated at 10.2 Mha yr ( ). But reforestation and afforestation
             rates have also decreased, resulting in a tropical forests net loss
             rate of 7.3 Mha yr in the 2015–2020 period. Overall, the net loss
             rate has slightly decreased (−4%) since 1990 ( ). However, a
             particularly high upward trend is observed in Central America and
             the Caribbean, while a small increase (2%) is observed in the
             tropical zone of Africa, during the periods from 2010–2015 to
             2015–2020 (Table CPP7.2).

<h3>CCP7.2.3 Drivers of Deforestation and Forest Degradation
                  Deforestation</h3>
                and forest degradation both affect carbon stocks, biodiversity loss and
                the provision of ecosystem services, leading to a reduction in
                resilience to climate change and exacerbating forest landscape
                vulnerability even in the absence of direct anthropogenic action ( )
                (Barlow et al., 2016; Aleixo et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2021; Saatchi et
                al., 2021). There is also clear evidence of deforestation influencing
                temperatures and the hydrological cycle at local to regional scales
                resulting in reduced precipitation and evaporation and increased runoff
                relative to unaffected areas ( ) [CCP7.3.6] (Jia et al., 2019; Douville
                et al., 2021). Negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems are
                predicted to undermine 80% of the Sustainable Development Goals targets
                related to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and
                land (IPBES, 2019). Therefore, besides greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation,
                reducing the driving forces leading to deforestation and forest
                degradation is of the utmost importance for forest resilience,
                biodiversity protection, avoiding regional climatic changes and the
                provision of critical ecosystem services, and communities whose
                livelihoods depend on forests ( ) (Curtis et al., 2018; IPBES, 2019; Jia
                et al., 2019; ; Pörtner et al., 2021; Saatchi et al., 2021). Drivers of
                deforestation and forest degradation can be distinguished between
                proximate (i.e., direct) and underlying (i.e., indirect). Direct
                drivers, such as agriculture (including crops, livestock and plantation
                forestry), infrastructure development (which often provides access to
                intact forests and catalyses deforestation) or timber extraction, are
                place-based and visible. They are influenced by underlying driving
                forces, such as demographic, economic, technological, political and
                institutional, or cultural factors, which typically form complex
                interactions and act at multiple scales, frequently without any direct
                connection to the areas of forest loss ( ). Agriculture is by far the
                largest direct driver of tropical deforestation, with great differences
                between commercial and subsistence farming and large variation across
                regions (Figure CCP7.3). Over 80% of tropical deforestation between 2000
                and 2010 was caused by agriculture, proportionally ranging from ca. 75%
                in Africa and Asia to ca. 95% in the Americas ( ), but both the scale of
                deforestation and the relative contribution of different drivers have
                changed considerably over time ( ) (Hosonuma et al., 2012; Curtis et
                al., 2018; ; ).

              Darker colour intensity indicates greater total quantity of forest cover
              loss. While some tropical forest cover loss is temporary, a large
              portion is related to deforestation. Source: Curtis et al. (2018).

              Forest degradation is more difficult to track, but can have large
              negative effects on carbon storage, provision of ecosystem services, and
              biodiversity (Griscom et al., 2017; ). A recent analysis suggests that
              forest degradation is increasing and is now surpassing deforestation
              rates in the Brazilian Amazon (Aparecido Trondoli Matricardi et al.,
              2020). As with deforestation, drivers of forest degradation differ by
              region, such that timber extraction was by far the most important
              degradation driver in Latin America and Asia, whereas in Africa wood
              fuel consumption contributed to about half of forest degradation between
              2000 and 2010 (Hosonuma et al., 2012). Though not as visible as direct
              drivers, indirect or underlying causes can greatly influence direct
              drivers, and must be addressed to reduce pressures on forests ( ) (e.g.,
              ; Fehlenberg et al., 2017; Pendrill et al., 2019b; Bos et al., 2020;
              Junquera et al., 2020; Ken et al., 2020; ; Siqueira-Gay et al., 2020; ).
              Next to population growth, poverty and insecure land tenure (Ariti et
              al., 2015; ; ; Ken et al., 2020; Siqueira-Gay et al., 2020; Verma et
              al., 2021), many developing tropical countries identify weak forest
              sector governance and institutions, lack of cross-sectoral coordination,
              and illegal activity (related to weak enforcement) as critical
              underlying drivers ( ; Ken et al., 2020; ) [CCP7.6]. International and
              market forces, particularly commodity markets and, increasingly,
              large-scale land acquisitions are also key underlying drivers ( )
              (Assunção et al., 2015; Henders et al., 2015; Conigliani et al., 2018;
              Ingalls et al., 2018; Garrett et al., 2019; Pendrill et al., 2019b; ; ;
              ) [WGII Chapter 5.13]. Deforestation related to commodity imports is
              increasing, illustrating the growing influence of global markets in
              deforestation dynamics (Henders et al., 2015). Although some of this
              production is consumed domestically, 29–39% of deforestation was driven
              by international trade, primarily from Europe, China, the Middle East
              and North America (Pendrill et al., 2019a). While many developed
              countries, as well as China and India, have achieved net domestic forest
              gains, their consumption patterns have increased deforestation embodied
              in their imports to varying degrees, frequently from biodiversity
              hotspots ( ). Fifty percent of the biodiversity loss associated with
              consumption in developed economies occurs outside their territorial
              boundaries (Wilting et al., 2017). The increasing prominence of medium-
              and large-scale clearings of forest between 2000 and 2012, particularly
              in Southeast Asia and South America, suggests the growing need for
              policy interventions targeting industrial-scale agricultural commodity
              producers (Austin et al., 2017). However, countries have been slow to
              address underlying drivers such as international demand for agricultural
              commodities. A review of 43 countries’ REDD+ readiness documents found
              that proposed policy interventions largely missed the agricultural
              drivers identified (Salvini et al., 2014). An assessment of policy
              responses to rubber and coffee production highlights the challenges
              governments face in identifying correlations between the direct drivers
              and related underlying drivers, with international drivers being the
              most challenging to address ( ).

<h1>CCP7.3 Current and Projected Climate Change Impacts on Tropical Forests (Drought, Temperature, Extreme
          Events)</h1>
        While early dynamic global vegetation models predicted biome shifts
            and contractions of tropical forests, more recent efforts have
            focused on biome changes at more regional scales, or on functional
            aspects of tropical forests, such as plant physiological and
            phenological changes, drought-related mortality, population
            dynamics, interspecies interactions and community responses,
            ecohydrology, risk of fire and related impacts, soil nutrient and
            microbe–plant interactions. Climate change is expected to increase
            temperatures across the tropics, with attendant variability in
            rainfall, and more extreme events such as intense storms, droughts
            and wildfires (Zelazowski et al., 2011; Malhi et al., 2014; Brando
            et al., 2019). This could be expected to have structural and
            functional impacts on tropical forest biomes (Malhi et al., 2014;
            Adams et al., 2017). This section looks at responses of tropical
            trees and forests to current and future climate-change related
            pressures, focusing on physiological responses including growth,
            mortality and regeneration, fire risk and ecological vulnerability,
            as well as on climate effects of tropical forest loss.

<h3>CCP7.3.1 Tropical Tree Physiological Responses to Climate Change</h3>
            With rising temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide, possibly
                accompanied by greater variability in soil moisture availability, a
                key question is how tropical forest trees respond physiologically
                (especially photosynthesis and respiration which determine net growth
                rates) and how well they can acclimate (i.e., able to adapt) to
                climate change (Dusenge et al., 2019). Key climate factors influencing
                tree growth on pan-tropical forests are precipitation, solar
                radiation, temperature amplitude and relative soil moisture (Wagner et
                al., 2014). The temperature response of photosynthetic carbon uptake
                in tropical trees seems remarkably similar across moist and dry forest
                types, as well as for light-demanding, fast-growing species compared
                with shade-tolerant, slow-growing species ( ). It is generally agreed
                that photosynthesis in tropical species can acclimate to moderate
                levels of warming but beyond this there would be no net gain in carbon
                ( ). The factor that limits photosynthesis in different tropical
                forests will depend on water availability. In water-limited dry
                forests, photosynthesis may decline largely due to stomatal closure,
                while in wet forests the decline may largely be driven by
                warming-related changes to leaf biochemistry ( ). A recent modelling
                approach suggests that the limits of photosynthetic thermal
                acclimation may be an increase of about 2°C, in terms of maximum
                tolerated temperature, with enhanced tree mortality beyond this level
                of warming ( ). A critical concern for plant function has been that
                higher temperatures will enhance respiration rates, potentially
                resulting in tropical forests becoming net carbon sources (rather than
                photosynthesis-driven carbon sinks) ( ). Some studies suggest that
                excessive respiration is less of a concern as respiration rates can
                acclimate to elevated temperatures over time ( ; ). Thermal
                acclimation of respiration has been shown in a seasonally dry
                neotropical forest ( ), while models indicate that increases in plant
                respiration could halve by the end of the 21st century through
                acclimation, thereby partly ameliorating the potential release of
                carbon from tropical forests ( ). A contrary view is that plant
                physiological processes, such as the photosynthesis in tropical canopy
                trees, are already functioning at levels close to or beyond their
                thermal optimum limits and that any further temperature increase would
                turn them from a sink into a carbon source ( ). One of the most
                pressing questions regarding forest responses to increasing
                atmospheric CO levels is whether trees experience enhanced growth
                rates as a result of the so-called CO fertilisation effect [Box 2.3 in
                IPCC 2019b]. Observed changes in the terrestrial carbon sink and
                process-based vegetation models indicate that tropical vegetation
                response to CO fertilisation ( ) is combined with other factors such
                as nitrogen deposition and length of the growing season, while
                aerosol-induced cooling may also have played a role in enhancing the
                carbon sink [Box 2.3 in IPCC 2019b]. Contrastingly, evidence for CO
                fertilisation of growth in individual tropical tree species is
                generally lacking or controversial ( ), or not as substantial as
                expected ( ). It is, however, widely agreed that the intrinsic
                water-use efficiency of a tree, that is, the amount of carbon
                assimilated as biomass per unit of water used, increases under
                elevated atmospheric CO levels owing to the regulation of stomata
                (cells on the leaf surface which regulate the exchange of water and
                gases between the plant and the atmosphere) ( ; ; ; ). Tropical dry
                forests (ca. 1000 mm annual rainfall) exhibit changes in water-use
                efficiency (WUE), relative to CO , at least twice as much as tropical
                moist forests (c. 4000 mm rainfall) ( ). Other key components in the
                forest system are plant–microbe–soil nutrient interactions, which play
                major roles in carbon cycling and plant photosynthetic response to
                increased atmospheric CO and warming (Zhang et al., 2014; ; Du et al.,
                2019). Phosphorus is generally a limiting factor in tropical forest
                soils, though this may be species-specific (Ellsworth et al., 2017;
                Turner et al., 2018). Mycorrhizal fungi (both arbuscular and
                ectomycorrhizal) play major roles in water acquisition of host plant
                and their responses to drought in dry tropical forest ( ) as well as
                in the capture and transfer of nutrients, especially nitrogen (which
                may otherwise become limiting), to host plants. Climate change factors
                can thus be expected to alter the nature of soil–plant interactions
                with consequences for the species composition and biodiversity of
                tropical ecosystems (Pugnaire et al., 2019; Terrer et al., 2019)

<div id="ccp7-3-2">
<h3>CCP7.3.2 Climate-Related Mortality and Regeneration in Tropical Forests</h3>
            Drought-related mortality of tropical trees shows complex patterns which
            could change forest community structure and composition with cascading
            effects on biodiversity (McDowell et al., 2020). During drought, the
            mortality rate is enhanced in larger-sized trees in tropical forests (as
            is the case with all forests globally), with significant impacts on
            forest structure, carbon storage and regional hydrology (Bennett et al.,
            2015). The mortality rate of neotropical moist forest trees appears to
            be consistently increasing since the 1980s (McDowell et al., 2020), with
            plant functional types such as softwood, pioneer and evergreen species
            suffering higher mortality during years of extreme drought (Aleixo et
            al., 2019). Large trees (&gt;30 cm diameter at breast height (dbh)) in
            tropical dry forests have much lower mortality rates than those reported
            for tropical moist forests (Suresh et al., 2010). Contrary to
            expectation, during prolonged droughts in these dry forests,
            deeper-rooted tree species are more to die than shallow-rooted ones,
            which are more adapted to changes in soil moisture content, because of
            water depletion in the deepest unsaturated zone (Chitra-Tarak et al.,
            2018). Regeneration of tropical tree seedlings and their response to a
            changing climate is inadequately understood. Experimental work suggests
            that tropical moist forest tree seedlings and saplings can acclimate
            photosynthetically to moderate levels of warming and, unlike adults, may
            even exhibit increased growth rates ( ; ). Some moist forest seedlings
            also show plasticity to recurrent drought episodes by enhancing their
            growth rates when favourable moisture conditions return, while others
            fail to respond (O’Brien et al., 2017). The nature of response also
            seems to be mediated by neighbourhood diversity, with greater plasticity
            in more diverse communities (O’Brien et al., 2017). Seedlings in
            tropical dry forests subject to burning show enhanced growth rates
            post-fire and within two years attain similar height of seedlings in
            unburnt areas (Pulla et al., 2015), though the environmental drivers of
            seedling growth post-fire are not well understood (Bhadouria et al.,
            2017). The net outcome of the population dynamics processes of growth,
            mortality and regeneration is change in species composition as a
            consequence of a changing climate. In the Amazon forests, dry
            habitat-affiliated genera have become more abundant among the newly
            recruited trees, while the mortality of moist habitat-affiliated genera
            has increased in places where the dry season has intensified most, thus
            driving a slow shift towards a drier forest type (Esquivel-Muelbert et
            al., 2019). A similar multi-decadal shift in West-African forest species
            composition towards more dry-affiliated species as a response to
            long-term drying has been recorded (Aguirre-Gutiérrez et al., 2020).
            While upward shifts in the tree line and in the range of individual tree
            species have been recorded at several temperate mountain regions,
            evidence from the tropics is rare. A large-scale study from 200 plot
            inventories of &gt;2000 tree species across a ~3000 m elevation gradient
            in the Andean tropics and sub-tropics has shown that the relative
            abundances of tree species from lower, warmer locations were increasing
            at these sites indicating that ‘thermophilisation of vegetation’
            (increased domination of plant species from warmer locations) was indeed
            taking place as expected (Fadrique et al., 2018) [Section 2.5.4.2.1 in
            Chapter 2].

<h3>CCP7.3.3 Fire Risks from Climate Change in Tropical Forests</h3>
           
                Temperature rise and prolonged droughts increase the danger of fires
                in drained peatlands and tropical forests in Southeast Asia and the
                Amazon (da Silva et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2018; Sullivan Martin et
                al., 2020), resulting in large carbon emissions, which reached 11.3 Tg
                CO day during September–October 2015 (Huijnen et al., 2016; Yin et
                al., 2020) and changes in forest composition and biodiversity (Asner
                et al., 2000; Hoffmann et al., 2003) ( ). In many cases, tree
                mortality due to fire is poorly recorded in the literature, but the
                available data suggest that fire-induced mortality has increased in
                recent years (Figure CCP7.2) (Malhi et al., 2014; Brando et al., 2019)
                ( ). While large forest and peat fires used to be associated mainly
                with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, there is now evidence
                that tropical rainforests in Indonesia may experience higher fire
                danger from increased temperatures even during non-drought years due
                to high evaporation rates of fragmented forests (Fernandes et al.,
                2017; McAlpine et al., 2018). The droughts of 2007 and 2010 in the
                Amazonian region caused 12% and 5% of the southeastern Amazon forests
                to burn, respectively, as compared with &lt;1% of these forests
                burning during non-drought years (Brando et al., 2014; da Silva Júnior
                et al., 2019; Pontes-Lopes et al., 2021). Moreover, degraded forests
                in Ghana are more vulnerable to fires during droughts (Dwomoh et al.,
                2019). Factors other than solely climate also interact in enhancing
                the danger of tropical forest fires. For instance, the extent of
                burned area of rainforests in Borneo has shown that subsurface
                hydrology, (i.e., hydrological drought), interacts with meteorological
                drought and, hence, fires have become more intense in recent decades
                following the progressive desiccation of the island over the past
                century (Taufik et al., 2017). Bornean forest fire risk also increased
                through the interaction of drought with land use conversion for
                logging, oil palm and tree plantations, and human settlements (Sloan
                et al., 2017). Similarly, simulations of future fire risks in the
                Amazon show that extensive land use change under the RCP 8.5 scenario
                results in 4- to 28-fold enhanced area of forest burned by fire by
                2080–2100, as compared with 1990–2010, whereas in an RCP 4.5 scenario,
                the area burned would be enhanced by 0.9- to 5.4-fold (Le Page et al.,2017).

<h3>CCP7.3.4 Current Climate Risks for Tropical Forests</h3>
                Impacts of climate change on tropical forest cover seem to correlate
                with climatic zone. Natural selection of drought tolerant species is
                observed in tropical dry forests under a prolonged water deficit
                environment ( ). Tropical montane forests are highly sensitive to
                warming and associated changes in cloud cover and moisture, with
                evidence that such forests are already being impacted through
                ‘browning’ (loss of biomass) from increased warming since the 1990s
                (Krishnaswamy et al., 2014). Besides higher temperatures, current
                climate risks also depend on regional responses to a variety of
                climate events. For example, tropical biomes across the three
                continents may respond differently to ENSO events in terms of carbon
                fluxes and balance. During the 2015–2016 ENSO event, different
                processes were dominant for the carbon fluxes anomaly in the tropical
                regions. In Asian forests, this anomaly was primarily derived from
                enhanced fire occurrence, in African forests through increased
                ecosystem respiration (from higher temperatures), and in South
                American forests by ecophysiological effects, through the gross
                primary production (GPP) expressed as reduced carbon uptake (Liu et
                al., 2017; van Schaik et al., 2018). It has also been shown that the
                probability of drought spells at the beginning and end of the rainy
                season is higher in the areas with the highest deforestation
                (Leite-Filho et al., 2019). Furthermore, it has been observed that
                Amazon rainforest resilience is being lost faster in regions with less
                rainfall and in parts of the rainforest that are closer to human
                activity ( ; Seiler et al., 2015) (CCP7.3.6). Conversely, it has been
                pointed out, on the basis of vegetation indices, that temperature has
                a greater influence on resilience than does precipitation, and
                tropical forests are more resilient to climate change when they are
                more diverse (Feng et al., 2021) (CCP7.3.6). Biomes such as seasonally
                dry tropical forests subject to higher variability in rainfall or
                other climatic factors may be more resilient to fire and drought
                (Pulla et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017), though there could be changes
                in species distributions as a result of disturbances (Allen et al.,
                2017). A regime of long-term, high rainfall variability seems to be
                critical in determining the overall resilience of tropical forests and
                savannas to climate disturbances (Ciemer et al., 2019), highlighting
                the heterogeneity of the tropical landscape to climate risk.
                Similarly, forest composition, nutrient limitations and biodiversity
                can influence forest resilience to disturbances. Recent evidence
                suggests that the degree of forest disturbance also affects the
                mechanisms through which biodiversity influences forest functioning
                (Schmitt et al., 2020). Neotropical secondary forests also showed high
                resilience by maintaining their biomass through high productivity and
                rates of recovery following major disturbances (Poorter et al., 2016).
                However, the possibility of tropical forests reaching ‘tipping points’
                in their resilience and experiencing rapid die-off cannot be ruled out
                (Verbesselt et al., 2016).

<h3>CCP7.3.5 Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Tropical Forest</h3>
                Climate change projections indicate increased warming and changes in
                    rainfall patterns in the tropical region as elsewhere globally (IPCC,
                    2021, AR6 WGI). These would have impacts on carbon stocks ( ; Hubau et
                    al., 2020), water availability (Tamoffo et al., 2019), and structure
                    and diversity (Malhi et al., 2014; McDowell et al., 2020) in tropical
                    forests, amplified by deforestation (CCP7.3.6). Tropical forests are
                    critical repositories of global carbon; living tropical trees are
                    estimated to hold 200–300 Pg C or about one-third of the levels in the
                    atmosphere ( ). CMIP5 and CMIP6 Earth System Models (ESM) project an
                    increasing future tropical carbon sink, which is particularly strong
                    in the scenarios with more pronounced increases in atmospheric CO
                    concentration (Koch et al., 2021). However, major uncertainties
                    regarding the ecophysiological processes governing carbon turnover and
                    tree mortality under a changing climate ( ; ), and the ecosystem-level
                    responses of tropical forests to elevated atmospheric CO ( ) explain
                    the contrast between observational data and modelling results ( ).
                    Observational data show that structurally intact old-growth tropical
                    forests have been net sinks of atmospheric carbon in recent decades,
                    but there is evidence that the capacity of such intact tropical
                    forests to build up carbon stock may be limited as biomass peaked
                    during the 1990s and has since weakened by 30% in the Amazon since the
                    1990s ( ), mainly due to increased tree mortality and faster carbon
                    turnover, and the African tropical forest sink following this trend
                    since about 2010 ( ; ). From a peak pan-tropical (Amazonia, Africa and
                    Southeast Asia) forest sink of 1.26 Pg C yr during the 1990s, it is
                    projected to decline to an uptake of only 0.29 Pg C yr , reaching zero
                    in the Amazon, during the 2030s ( ). This decline will possibly be
                    driven by the reduced rates of forest carbon uptake from the weakening
                    global CO fertilisation effect mediated by limiting soil nutrient, and
                    reduced water availability and higher temperatures during extreme
                    droughts ( ; ; ), reinforced by deforestation and forest degradation
                    [IPCC SRCCL, 2019]. Offline (uncoupled) vegetation model simulations
                    indicate that the extensive tropical and subtropical forests of the
                    Americas could gradually transit towards a savanna-like vegetation,
                    with the most pronounced shifts (of up to 600 km northward) from
                    relatively stable forests to savanna-forest transitions occurring in
                    the eastern Amazonian region (Huntingford et al., 2013; Anadon et al.,
                    2014; Nobre et al., 2016) depending largely on the yet uncertain
                    strength of the CO fertilisation effect and future dry season length,
                    with important feedbacks on the flux of moisture from the forest to
                    the atmosphere (Zemp et al., 2017). More limited simulations for
                    Central American rainforests under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 also support a
                    transition in some areas to lower biomass tropical dry forest and
                    savanna-like vegetation (Lyra et al., 2017). Such transitions from one
                    biome type to another will cause major changes in forest structure,
                    species compositions and overall biodiversity. Additionally, the
                    difficulty of species to migrate through highly fragmented tropical
                    forested regions (such as West Africa or South and Southeast Asia) and
                    ‘non-analogue climates’, under a climate change scenario, poses extra
                    pressure on tropical biodiversity to adapt and survive (Pörtner et
                    al., 2021). Even in expansive tracts of forests, such as in the
                    Amazon, climate change is expected to become more important than
                    deforestation by 2050 in causing the loss of tree species (Gomes et
                    al., 2019). Tropical mountain biodiversity hotspots (e.g., Andes,
                    Himalayas) are particularly vulnerable to species loss due to
                    elevation range shifts (Sekercioglu et al., 2008). Under a 2°C
                    increase scenario, a substantial reduction of tropical montane cloud
                    forest in Kenya is estimated (Los et al., 2019).

<h3>CCP7.3.6 Climate Responses to Tropical Deforestation and Links to Forest
                  Resilience </h3>
                Since AR5, there has been meaningful advancement in understanding the
                    climate effects of deforestation and concomitant changes in forest
                    ecosystem resilience. The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and
                    Land (Jia et al., 2019) and IPCC AR6 WGI (Douville et al., 2021) both
                    describe significant climate-related changes resulting from tropical
                    deforestation ( ). Deforestation generally reduces rainfall and
                    enhances temperatures and landscape dryness; effects that increase
                    with the scale of forest loss, whereas reforestation and afforestation
                    generally reverses these effects ( ) ( ; ; Khanna et al., 2017; Jia et
                    al., 2019; Staal et al., 2020; Douville et al., 2021; Hofmann et al.,
                    2021; Leite-Filho et al., 2021). There is also from observations and
                    modelling that deforestation enhances surface runoff (Douville et al.,
                    2021). Whereas quantitative information is much more limited for other
                    tropical regions, past deforestation in the Amazon has led to a small
                    reduction in rainfall of −2.3% to −1.3%, shortening and delay of the
                    wet season, and an estimated 4% increase in dryness (Leite-Filho et
                    al., 2020; Staal et al., 2020; Douville et al., 2021). Modelling
                    studies estimate that large-scale tropical deforestation will
                    contribute to average warming of the deforested areas with +0.61 ±
                    0.48°C and will lead to large changes in diurnal temperature ranges
                    owing to a reduction of nocturnal cooling ( ) (Jia et al., 2019).
                    Large-scale deforestation will also strongly decrease average regional
                    precipitation and evapotranspiration and further delay the onset of
                    the wet season, enhancing the chance of dry spells and intensifying
                    dry seasons, but the magnitude of the decline depends on the scale and
                    type of land-cover change ( ) (Zemp et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019;
                    Douville et al., 2021; Gatti et al., 2021). Continued forest landscape
                    drying and fragmentation in connection with deforestation may also
                    enhance surface flow variability (Farinosi et al., 2019; Souza et al.,
                    2019) and will aggravate the risk of forest dieback (Zemp et al.,
                    2017), elevate forest flammability (Alencar et al., 2015) and increase
                    fire incidence ( ) (Aragão et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019; Silveira et
                    al., 2020; dos Reis et al., 2021), ultimately leading to savannisation
                    of many tropical rainforests (Sales et al., 2020). However,
                    compositional heterogeneity and diversity of forest assemblages
                    increases resilience against climate-enhanced forest degradation
                    (Réjou-Méchain et al., 2021). For the Amazon, deforestation (ca. 40%
                    of the region) in combination with climate change will raise the
                    prospect of passing a tipping point leading to large-scale
                    savannisation of the rainforest biome, but uncertainty remains whether
                    this will take place in the 21st century (Nobre et al., 2016; Jia et
                    al., 2019; Douville et al., 2021). However, considering that the
                    Amazon has already lost ca. 20% of its forests (Nobre et al., 2016),
                    crossing the tipping point may not only create savannas of the
                    deforested parts but may also result in precipitation reductions of
                    40% in non-deforested parts of the western Amazon due to a breakdown
                    of the South American monsoonal circulation and the subsequent western
                    cascade of precipitation and evapotranspiration (Boers et al., 2017).
                    Other effects of forest degradation include loss of ecosystem
                    services, biodiversity, carbon storage and Indigenous culture (Watson
                    et al., 2018; Strassburg et al., 2019; Gatti et al., 2021), as well as
                    potentially reduced hydropower capacity and agricultural production
                    (Sumila et al., 2017), and increases in tropical diseases (Husnina et
                    al., 2019). The dearth of data for tropical forest regions other than
                    the Amazon makes assessments of deforestation-related changes in
                    temperature, precipitation and streamflow difficult ( ), and hampers
                    estimates of tropical forest ecosystem health, biodiversity loss and
                    vulnerability to current and future climatic and other pressures ( ).
                    There is, hence, a strong need for increased investment in relevant
                    data and research to narrow the knowledge gaps (Davison et al., 2021).
                    Nonetheless, conclusions based on a newly developed tropical
                    vulnerability index synthesising remotely sensed land use and climate
                    information indicate that forests in the Americas are already reaching
                    critical levels to multiple stressors, while forests in Asia reveal
                    vulnerability primarily to land-use change and African forests still
                    show relative resilience to climate change (Saatchi et al., 2021).

<h1>CCP7.4 Social-Economical Vulnerabilities of Indigenous Peoples and Local
        Communities Living in Tropical Forests</h1>
    
        Around 800 million people live in or in the immediate vicinity of
        tropical forests ( ). Short-term impacts of climate change on
        biodiversity will exacerbate the inequalities affecting those
        livelihoods which heavily rely on forests (Pörtner et al., 2021).
        Livelihoods, gender, land-use change and dependency on forest
        resources for food, fuel, housing and other needs have been identified
        as key elements of vulnerability in Indigenous Peoples and rural
        communities in Africa and South America ( ) ( ; ; ; ; ; ).
        Socioeconomic vulnerability varies depending on the level of
        dependency of forest food consumption ( ), livelihood strategies and
        settlement patterns. In Cameroon ( ), nomadic hunter-gatherers and
        sedentary communities showed differences in their vulnerability,
        driven by their preferences in forest settlement locations for
        farming, hunting, fishing, gathering, trapping and maintaining
        livestock. Increasing temperatures, extreme climatic events, drought
        and fire will affect the proportion and frequency of forest resources
        availability. In communities of tropical America, Asia and Africa,
        social vulnerability factors identified include: deforestation
        pressures for agriculture expansion to cope with climate-induced food
        shortages, conflicts over access to forest land as a result of
        uncontrolled fire induced by higher drought frequency and severity,
        the availability of wild game, the work capacity, and the time
        consumed in work and gender-based differences (Blaser et al, 2011; ;
        ). Although the size and quality of harvest in crops and non-timber
        forest products (NTFPs) will be affected, the literature reports the
        use of NTFPs, hunting and fishing is less sensitive to climate change,
        and relevant for household incomes ( ; ; ; ). Data from tropical
        forests document the contribution of NTFPs to local livelihoods
        (Issaka, 2018), with well-established NTFPs such as Brazil nut ( ),
        rattan ( and species), rubber ( species) and açai ( ) showing promise
        for sustainable harvesting strategies which could reduce socioeconomic
        vulnerability ( ). The decrease of tropical forest area due to
        land-use change will put additional pressures, threatening livelihood
        practices, traditional land arrangements and customary rights of
        forest-dependent communities, and impacting the Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDG) of Climate Action and Life on Land ( ; Tiani
        et al., 2015; Hurlbert et al., 2019). Globalised trade relations,
        agricultural expansion, illegal activities and violent conflicts have
        been identified as important non-climatic drivers of forest
        degradation ( ) ( ; Rist et al., 2012; Shanley et al., 2012;
        Ruiz-Mallén et al., 2017; ; IPBES et al., 2018). Globally, about 70%
        of tropical forest areas occur outside protected areas. In Latin
        America and the Caribbean, Indigenous Peoples and local communities
        have predominant ownership of tropical forest lands, while in West and
        Central Africa and Asia, forested areas are largely state-owned with
        exacerbating problems of governance, inequity and conflict with
        customary land tenure systems (Blaser et al., , 2011). Further
        research by experts and local stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples is
        required to design more accurate and comprehensive indicators (Huong
        et al., 2019). Solid evidence shows important knowledge and
        experiences that Indigenous Peoples and local communities contribute
        to disaster risk reduction and management ( a). Recognising the land
        rights of Indigenous Peoples is among the most cost-effective actions
        to address climate and biodiversity risks according to . In Indigenous
        Peoples’ forest lands in the Amazon basin, deforestation rates are up
        to 50% lower than in other forested areas (Ding et al., 2016), and
        Indigenous management is correlated with reduced carbon emissions ( ).
        Indigenous authors and local authors have pointed out the role of
        traditional systems of governance, knowledge and belief systems in the
        resilience of Indigenous Peoples and rural communities in the
        Amazonian and Andean regions, by regulating seed access and the
        conservation of agrobiodiversity and tropical forest (Camico et al.,
        2021; Mustonen et al., 2021). In the Philippines, the traditional land
        use system Muyong promotes sustainable agroforestry management based
        on customary land laws (Camacho et al., 2016). Participation of local
        stakeholders and the inclusion of a gender perspective contribute to
        prioritising resource allocation and the development of effective
        legal frameworks for adaptation (Shah et al., 2013; Tiani et al.,
        2015; Ihalainen et al., 2017; Collantes et al., 2018). There is a need
        to combine quantitative and qualitative methods, and increase research
        efforts to integrated approaches; including multi-scalar and
        interdisciplinary assessments of vulnerability (Djoudi et al., 2013;
        Guidi et al., 2018; ).

<h1>CCP7.5 Adaptation Options, Costs and Benefits</h1>
    Ecological adaptation and
    other spontaneous responses to climate change are discussed in Settele
    et al. (2015) and [AR6 WGII_Chapter 2] Here we consider the role of
    humans in managing the adaptation of tropical forests to climate change.
    The focus is on human-assisted adaptation options that help to maintain
    tropical forest ecosystems and not on the use of forests to supply
    provisioning services, such as timber, which is covered in [AR6
    WGII_Chapter 5]. Forest management and agroforestry are discussed, but
    only with regard to their role in contributing to the adaptation of
    tropical ecosystems now and in the future. Maintaining ecosystems has a
    range of co-benefits for humans, including through ‘ecosystem-based
    adaptation’. These are explored in [Box 1.3; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL
    in Chapter 2, Box CCP7.2 ]. Although there are a number of potentially
    valuable response options, it is clear that certain hazards, such as
    heatwaves, may be impossible to manage at the forest community level and
    require long-term interventions at the landscape scale. Similarly, it
    will be difficult for forest managers to adapt to indirect
    climate-related ecosystem disturbances such as loss of pollination
    agents, invasive species or pest and diseases outbreaks (Allen et al.,
    2010; Anderegg et al., 2020). Equally important in adapting to increased
    pressure from climate change are efforts to minimise disturbance from
    non-climatic stress factors (e.g., overharvesting, pollution and land
    use change; Malhi et al., 2014; ; Barlow et al., 2016; Pörtner et al.,
    2021). Under some emissions scenarios, projected climate change impacts
    are of such severity that no adaptation measure is to protect natural
    forest systems; for example, with warming of 4°C, some tropical forests
    are at risk of die-back from high temperature (Malhi et al., 2014;
    Settele et al., 2015; Trumbore et al., 2015). Actions to protect the
    extent or reduce the disturbance pressure on forest systems contribute
    to the capacity of these systems to respond to climate change
    (increasing resistance and resilience) ( ) (Millar et al., 2007; Schmitz
    et al., 2015; Settele et al., 2015; Sakschewski et al., 2016; Hisano et
    al., 2018). Furthermore, if implemented sufficiently well, efforts to
    manage and restore forests also improve the capacity of forest systems
    to respond to future climate stressors (increasing resilience and
    responsiveness). Table CCP7.3 gives an overview of adaptation strategies
    for tropical forests within the framework of protect, manage, restore
    (Sayer et al., 2003; Pörtner et al., 2021). In assessing the available
    adaptation options, it can be useful to distinguish between actions
    focused on protecting forest extent, managing biodiversity, managing
    ecosystem function or restoring ecosystem services ( ), Figure CCP7.5
    and Table CCP7.4 give a detailed assessment of the major adaptation
    options in this context. Beyond these specific interventions, and in
    several cases underpinning them, there is an increasing awareness that
    effective management and adaptation of tropical forests requires an
    appreciation of IK, LK and CBA for implementation to be meaningful;
    these approaches are assessed in [Box CCP7.1 ]

    HCVA, high conservation value areas; HCSA, high carbon stock areas;
    IPLC, Indigenous Peoples and local communities. The information
    supporting this figure originates from an extensive literature review
    that is included in this section, Table CCP7.4. The assessment of
    confidence levels is based on the judgement of the authors based on the
    reviewed literature and follows IPBES guidelines.
    <br/>Purely scientific knowledge, albeit indispensable, is insufficient to
    address climate change. Indigenous knowledge systems, embedded in social
    and cultural structures, are integral to climate resilience and
    adaptation ( ) ( ; Tengö et al., 2014; Hiwasaki et al., 2015; ) [AR5
    WGII (Adger et al. 2014), AR5 WGII Section 20.4.2 (Denton et al. 2014),
    SRCCL (Olsson et al. 2019), SRCCL (Olsson et al. 2019), SR15 (de Coninck
    et al. 2018) ]. knowledge and local knowledge (IK and LK) and
    community-based adaptation (CBA) have received increasing recognition
    across all sectors ( ) ( ; Wright et al., 2014; Moste, 2015) [SRCCL
    (Olsson et al. 2019), SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019), SR15 Box 4.3 (de Coninck
    et al. 2018)] (Figure Box CCP7.1.1). Forest Indigenous knowledge (IK) is
    closely linked to traditional land-use practices and local governance
    (Roberts et al., 2009); it is embodied in art, rituals, food,
    agriculture and customary laws, among others (Hiwasaki et al., 2015;
    Camico et al., 2021). CBA is a community-led process based on its
    desires, priorities, knowledge and capacities which empowers people as
    central players in climate change adaptation (Reid et al., 2009) [SRCCL
    5.3.5]. CBA is related with concepts such as community and adaptive
    collaborative forest management. These approaches acknowledge the
    importance of cultural and socioeconomic ties between communities and
    forests, along with community’s authority and responsibility for forest
    sustainable management ( ; Ellis et al., 2015; Torres et al., 2015).
    Role of IK and LK and CBA for Climate Change Adaptation in Tropical
    Forests Local forest and Indigenous forest management systems have
    developed over long time periods, generating social practices and
    institutions that have supported livelihoods and cultures for
    generations ( ) ( ; Martin et al., 2010; ; Camico et al., 2021).
    Archaeological evidence shows that humans have manipulated tropical
    forests for at least 45,000 years ( ). Indigenous Peoples usually
    consider themselves as parts of socio-ecosystems, protecting the forest
    by maintaining healthy socio-ecological relationships and successfully
    adapting to environmental change (Speranza et al., 2010; Swiderska et
    al., 2011; ; Uprety et al., 2012; Mistry et al., 2016; Roberts et al.,
    2017) [AR5 WGII Setion 12.3.2 (Adger et al. 2014)]. CBA ensures
    community engagement in bottom-up management and adaptation approaches (
    ; ). IK, LK and CBA can enhance adaptation in many ways, including
    through knowledge generation, ecosystem monitoring, climate forecasting,
    increased resilience and response to climate extremes and slow-onset
    events (Speranza et al., 2010) [AR5 WGII (Adger et al. 2014); SRCCL
    (Olsson et al. 2019)] ] (Figure Box CCP7.1.1). Integration of IK and LK
    Systems, CBA and Modern Scientific Systems Several authors have
    highlighted the need to foster a respectful dialogue between Indigenous
    knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) and modern science towards a
    holistic research model ( ) ( ; ; Tengö et al., 2014; ) [AR5 WGII (Adger
    et al. 2014) , AR5 WGII (Noble et al. 2014)], but few ecological studies
    have attempted this integration ( ; ). Examples in tropical forest
    ecosystems include topics such as monitoring climate impacts; local
    climates; seed, water and land management resilience-increasing
    practices; and climate threats to traditional agriculture ( ;
    Fernández-Llamazares et al., 2017; Camico et al., 2021; Mustonen et al.,
    2021). A growing number of methods are available to help this dialogue
    [SRCCL Section 7.5.1 (Hurlbert et al. 2019)] (Reid et al., 2009; Tengö
    et al., 2014; Tengö et al., 2017; ) (Figure Box CCP7.1.1). While there
    is expanding interest among decision makers, researchers, Indigenous
    Peoples and civil society on IK and LK (Hiwasaki et al., 2015; ), gaps
    remain regarding links between place-and-culture dimensions and adaptive
    capacities (Ford et al., 2016). Enhancing Adaptive Capacity through IK
    and LK and CBA: Lessons Learned Useful lessons can be drawn from
    experience to effectively incorporate IK, LK and CBA in adaptation
    strategies. A number of barriers to adaptation have also been recognised
    (Figure Box CCP7.1.1). Considering that IK and LK is increasingly
    threatened by colonisation, acculturation, dispossession of land rights,
    and environmental and social change, among others [AR5 WGII (Adger et
    al. 2014); SR15Section 4.3.5 (de Coninck et al. 2018)] highlighted the
    importance of supporting community efforts to document, vitalise and
    protect it. It is essential to consider goals, identity and livelihood
    priorities of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, including those
    beyond natural resource management (Reid et al., 2009; ; Zavaleta et
    al., 2018). Adaptation processes are more to be transformational when
    they are locally driven ( : ) ( ; ). This requires adaptive
    institutional frameworks, capable of navigating the complex dynamic of
    socio-ecosystems ( : ) (Locatelli et al., 2008; ) [AR5 WGII (Adger et
    al. 2014), SR15 (Roy et al. 2018)]. It is important to consider power
    relations and priority differences to avoid causing social disruption
    and inequality. ‘We need to keep asking: Who benefits? Who loses? Who is
    empowered? Who is disempowered?’ (Reid et al., 2009). Finally,
    vulnerability and adaptive capacity have a historical and geopolitical
    context, conditioned by value systems and development models. Forest
    management strategies must take into account the wider picture if they
    seek to be not just temporally effective (at best), but transformative
    and sustainable over time ( ) ( ; ). Agricultural expansion is the major driver of deforestation in
    developing countries. Cost of reducing deforestation is based on
    opportunity cost of not growing the most common crop in developing
    countries (maize) for 6 years to reach tree maturity, with yield of 8 t
    ha (high); 5 tons ha (medium), and 1.5 t ha , with a price of USD 329 t
    . Also, reduced deforestation practices have relatively moderate costs,
    but they require transaction and administration costs ( ; ). May not
    deal with displacement of wild species due to climate change. Fragments
    of disconnected HCVAs have less value to preserve ecological services.
    Forest management strategies may decrease stand-level structural
    complexity and may make forest ecosystems more susceptive to natural
    disasters like wind throws, fires and diseases (Seidl et al., 2017).

<h3>CCP7.5.1 Adaptation Options at Different Scales</h3>
        To retain functioning tropical forests, adaptation will need to take
        place across many scales, from individual stands to interconnected
        landscapes, and upwards to regional and global policy changes. From a
        global perspective, the most effective adaptation and mitigation
        option is to reduce and reverse the loss of area in tropical forest
        ecosystems ( ; Griscom et al., 2017). Maximising tropical forest
        extent has well-described benefits in mitigating CO emissions and in
        the role of forests regulating global climate ( ) (Smith et al.,
        2014). For nations with tropical forests, adaptation is largely
        achieved through sustainable management of forested areas, enforcing
        the land rights/land tenure of Indigenous Peoples, and through
        establishment of protected areas (Table CCP7.4; ; Pörtner et al.,
        2021). Some of this is achieved through schemes incentivising
        landowners to retain tree cover for the express purpose of mitigating
        climate change impacts (e.g., PES- Payments for Ecosystem Services,
        REDD+ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).
        For nations outside of the tropics, there is a need to regulate the
        global drivers of forest loss, such as the consumption of agricultural
        commodities and of non-sustainable forest products (including timber)
        (CCP7.3; Henders et al., 2015 Nolte et al., 2017, Pendrill et al.,
        2019). At a landscape scale, increasing forest cover and maintaining
        biodiversity friendly land-use outside forests increases ecosystem
        resilience to climate change (and other disturbances) and allows for
        climate-driven species migration, for example, ‘protect’ in Table
        CCP7.3 (Schmitz et al., 2015; ). Ensuring forested areas are large
        and/or interconnected including the use of specific climate refugia
        and climate corridors is recommended for climate adaptation ( )
        (Schmitz et al., 2015; Settele et al., 2015; Simmons et al., 2018;
        Pörtner et al., 2021). For habitats or species pushed to the edge of
        their range, area-based conservation needs to take account of the
        future climate space and facilitate movement of species through
        connectivity or assisted migration ( ; Schmitz et al., 2015; Pörtner
        et al., 2021). Maintaining functioning forest ecosystems is vital due
        to biophysical, biological (biodiversity-driven) and socioeconomic
        interactions that contribute to ecosystem resilience (Pielke Sr et
        al., 2011; Malhi et al., 2014; ; ; Sakschewski et al., 2016).
        Protecting forested areas can be achieved through vertical integration
        of policies at national, subnational and local levels and effective
        stakeholder empowerment ( ). Community-based and ecosystem-based
        adaptation approaches provide an overall strategy to help achieve
        these goals [Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2] (Locatelli et
        al., 2010; ). In addition to conservation of tropical forests,
        restoration and afforestation can be effective climate adaptation
        measures (e.g., ‘restore’ in Table CCP7.3) ( ; Perugini et al., 2017).
        The technical requirements for such adaptation measures are similar to
        those required for forest landscape restoration ( ; Mansourian et al.,
        2017; Shimamoto et al., 2018; Philipson et al., 2020). Agricultural
        intensification has been proposed as one method to reduce pressure on
        remaining forested land, although the overall carbon impact of such
        approaches must be considered (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in SRCCL, Shukla et
        al., 2019; Cerri et al., 2018; Kubitza et al., 2018). At the forest
        community level, adaptation options aim to protect the forest
        microenvironment and retain biodiversity through forest management
        (e.g., ‘manage’ in Table CCP7.3) ( ; Jactel et al., 2017). In
        protected areas, this would typically involve reinforcing existing
        conservation objectives through adaptive management (Salafsky et al.,
        2001; Ellis et al., 2015; Tanner-McAllister et al., 2017; ), including
        support for natural regeneration (Chazdon et al., 2016). It is also
        possible to improve forest cover and interconnectivity through
        restoration or afforestation. There are many technical guides to
        improve the implementation and success rate of such approaches (Table
        CCP7.4) ( ; Shimamoto et al., 2018; Strassburg et al., 2019) and
        funding support specifically aimed at climate change adaptation and
        mitigation (e.g., REDD+). In some instances, climate change can alter
        climate suitability to the extent that managers need to allow for a
        transition to a new habitat type (e.g., from tropical forest to
        savanna), adaptive management can help recognise and facilitate these
        transitions ( ; Schmitz et al., 2015; Lapola et al., 2018). Depending
        on local conditions, it will be necessary to adapt to specific stress
        factors that are to increase in prevalence or severity because of
        climate change, such as heatwaves, drought events and forest fires
        (Allen et al., 2010; Malhi et al., 2014; Seidl et al., 2017). Although
        it is typically not possible to link individual events or adaptation
        measures to climate change, the effectiveness of technical
        interventions has been illustrated in a broader forest management
        context. Table CCP7.4 assesses the costs and benefits of different
        adaptation options based on the available literature. However, it
        should be noted that there is lack of information on many potential
        adaptation interventions, especially in the context of tropical
        forests (Locatelli et al., 2010; Bele et al., 2015; ; ). The sections
        below and Figure CCP7.5 offer a framework for optimising management of
        complex tropical forest ecosystems within a landscape context, through
        a range of interconnected adaptation options.

<div id="ccp7-5-2">
<h3>CCP7.5.2 Adaptation Response Options</h3>  
      Forests will be affected by several climate change impacts that will
        require forest management towards fulfilling four objectives: maintain
        forest area; facilitate biodiversity adaptation; maintain healthy
        functioning forest ecosystems; and restore ecosystem services
        (including productive capacity) ( ), which complement the more
        conventional approaches to protect, manage and restore forests (Sayer
        et al., 2003). This is dependent on location-specific conditions that
        are defined by the type of forest and land tenure regimes or dominant
        actors across forest landscapes. The analysis here proposes 10
        adaptation responses that focus on the adaptation potential of
        tropical forests to climate change and are linked to the management
        objectives identified (Figure CCP7.5). Each response option (1–10)
        implies variable economic costs and benefits, influenced by
        location-specific conditions, including several important
        non-monetised benefits. The figure suggests the most relevant
        situations in which the different response options hold greater
        potential to meet the forest management objectives for addressing
        expected climate change impacts. This assessment considers the
        economic costs and benefits of 10 response options in their
        contribution to adaptation of tropical forests to climate change
        impacts but also includes non-market costs that are more difficult to
        quantify (e.g., cultural values), which are borne by different
        stakeholders (Chan et al., 2016; Pascual et al., 2017). Similarly,
        benefits also include the social and environmental benefits that
        result from adaptation options over extended time horizons. Economic
        costs and benefit–cost ratios suggest the short-term economic
        potential of different options, but responsibly designed adaptation
        measures involving a combination of different response options and
        embracing a long-time horizon have the potential to provide
        significant social and climate benefits over the coming 50 years or
        more.

<h3>CCP7.5.3 Costs</h3>
        The cost of implementing adaptation options varies widely and will
            change based on the location, time horizon and who bears the cost. As
            a result, most existing estimates are offered in broad ranges that
            include only partial cost estimates. Here we group the adaptation
            costs into three categories: low- (&lt;USD 1000 ha ), medium- (between
            USD 1000 ha and USD 5000 ha ) and high-cost options (&gt;USD 5000 ha
            ).
            <ul>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Low-cost options are those estimated to cost less than USD 1000 ha
                and include recognition of tenure rights of Indigenous Peoples and
                local communities ( ), restoring ecological connectivity ( ;
                Torrubia et al., 2014), fire prevention and management (Griscom et
                al., 2017; Arneth et al., 2019), assisted natural regeneration ( ;
                Lira et al., 2012; MMA, 2017; ) and sustainable forest management
                (Boltz et al., 2001; Holmes et al., 2002; ; ; ).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Medium-cost options are those estimated to cost between USD 1000
                and USD 5000 ha and include estimates for tree planting ( ;
                Campos-Filho et al., 2013; ; Nello et al., 2019) and avoided
                deforestation (Kindermann et al., 2008; Overmars et al., 2014;
                Smith et al., 2019).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                High-cost options are those estimated to cost more than USD 5000
                ha and include actions associated with agroforestry systems,
                particularly the most biodiverse systems (Raes et al., 2017; Nello
                et al., 2019).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Costs per hectare are either not available or vary too widely for
                several options, including protected areas ( ; Bruner et al.,
                2004) and high-value conservation areas in working lands ( ).
                Griscom et al., (2017) provided recent estimated costs for many of
                the above adaptation options; in most cases, these costs are much
                lower than other estimates referenced here, which are particularly
                focused on tropical forest landscapes.
              </li>
</ul>
            While economic costs constitute an important factor in determining the
            feasibility of options, there are other factors that have an important
            influence on the viability of the options including opportunity costs,
            transaction costs and social feasibility, which are not included in
            this analysis. For example, options such as recognition of rights for
            Indigenous Peoples and local communities can be a low-cost option but
            often face political opposition ( ), including from some conservation
            organisations; fire prevention and management require political
            coordination across multiple governance levels (Fonseca-Morello et
            al., 2017); and sustainable forest management can be seen as a less
            attractive option when compared with other more profitable land uses (
            ). Table CCP7.4 offers a more detailed assessment of the costs
            included, along with a reference to the costs for society.

<h3>CCP7.5.4 Benefits</h3>
        Estimates of economic benefits across options tend to vary greatly,
            largely based on the scale of operations, and the market and
            institutional contexts in which they are implemented. The longer-term
            non-monetary benefits tend to be larger than has been acknowledged in
            the past (Chan et al., 2016; Pascual et al., 2017; ). The shorter-term
            horizon of the economic benefits of adaptation options suggest that
            benefit-cost ratios of investments are higher in more biodiverse
            agroforestry systems in comparison with simpler ones (Miccolis et al.,
            2016), and agroforestry system benefits are comparatively higher
            compared with commercial tree planting depending on the species (Table
            CCP7.4; Nello et al., 2019). All the objectives here support not only
            a large number of local people in fulfilling their livelihoods, but
            often provide services to distant urban populations as well. The
            benefits differ according to which of the four forest landscape
            management objectives is prioritised (Table CCP7.4):
            <ul>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Objectives that seek to maintain the extent of forests contribute
                to improved landscape continuity, persistence of species and
                metapopulations (including floral recruitment) ( ), maintaining
                hydrological cycles ( ) and avoiding surface temperature increases
                ( ). In many cases high conservation value areas (HCVAs) are based
                on the presence of threatened or endemic species or dense,
                carbon-rich forest ecosystems (e.g., primary forest) ( ).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Objectives that prioritise natural regeneration and adaptation of
                biological diversity allow greater opportunity for climate refugia
                ( ; ), provide increased dispersal opportunities for different
                species ( ), increase flora and fauna diversity, and may provide
                small benefits in reducing warming ( ).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Objectives to maintain and enhance the quality and persistence of
                vital forest ecosystems contribute to securing the provision of
                habitat, maintain soil structure and fertility, and regulate water
                quantity and quality ( ; ).
              </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
                Objectives that prioritise the restoration of ecological
                productivity of degraded forest ecosystems and landscapes
                contribute to increased biodiversity conservation, soil structure
                and fertility, nutrient cycling, water infiltration/water
                recharge, erosion control and climate regulation ( ; ; ).

<h3>CCP7.5.5
        Strategic Approaches to Combine Response Options</h3>
        While adaptation costs and benefits of response options differ, their
            benefit-to-cost ratios are almost always positive, particularly in the
            longer term ( ; Chausson et al., 2020; Seddon et al., 2020; Baste et
            al., 2021). However, implementation of adaptation actions can be
            economically unviable if the benefits accrue over longer periods of
            time because development banks apply much higher discount rates to low
            income countries than the standard rates ( ). Achieving conditions
            that do not disincentivise against, and rather encourage investments
            in nature-based solutions to protect, sustainably manage or restore
            tropical forest landscapes is therefore critical to enhancing their
            implementation ( ). In addition, implementation of response options
            should consider equity aspects to ensure that the costs and benefits
            of actions within a landscape are equitably distributed among public
            institutions, private enterprise and civil society ( ). Strategic
            approaches to restoring ecosystems can increase conservation gains and
            reduce costs (Shimamoto et al., 2018; Strassburg et al., 2019).
            Cost-effective solutions that consider multiple costs and benefits
            need a ‘compromise solution’ between short- and long-term social and
            economic gains. Pursuing spatial allocations for adaptation options
            has the potential to deliver greater benefits at lower costs,
            therefore aligning aims for tropical forest adaptation, species
            conservation and climate mitigation targets with the interests of
            farmers under short and long time horizons (Beatty et al., 2018).

            Overview of adaptation strategies for tropical forests. This table
            includes key policy frameworks and common management approaches with
            potential for adapting native forests to increased disturbance from
            climate hazards. Details on each management approach and the

                      Forests counteract wind-driven degradation of soils, and
                      contribute to soil erosion protection and soil fertility
                      enhancement for agricultural resilience ( ). The impact of
                      reduced deforestation may be higher when the large
                      biophysical impacts on the water cycle (and thus drought)
                      are taken into account (e.g., ). Reducing deforestation and

                      diseases (e.g., malaria) (Karjalainen et al., 2010).
                      Avoiding deforestation contributes to climate change

                      and services, and a similar species richness of animals,
                      insects and plants to that found in nearby old-growth forest
                      but can be more susceptible to defaunation and fire (Edwards
                      et al., 2014). Sustainable forest management plays a role in
                      adaptation by ensuring that through long-term forest
                      management the diversity of forests is maintained as well as
                      benefits from forest resource use (Putz et al., 2012).
                      Improved forest management positively impacts adaptation by
                      limiting the negative effects associated with pollution (of
                      air and fresh water), diseases, and exposure to extreme

                      Forest landscape restoration positively affects the
                      structure and function of degraded ecosystems (Shimamoto et
                      al., 2018). Forest restoration may enhance connectivity
                      between forest areas and help conserve biodiversity hotspots
                      (Locatelli et al., 2015a; ; ). Forest restoration may
                      improve ecosystem functionality and services, provide
                      microclimatic regulation for people and crops, wood and
                      fodder as safety nets, soil erosion protection and soil
                      fertility enhancement ( ). Land restoration can reduce
                      future risks (e.g., by protecting against hazards) and
                      current vulnerability (e.g., by diversifying livelihoods)
                      (Pramova et al., 2019). Natural forest regeneration
                      contributes to climate mitigation through carbon removals
                      (Lewis et al., 2019), and this would imply less need for
                      climate adaptation.

<h1>CCP7.6 Governance of Tropical Forests for Resilience and Adaptation to
      Climate Change</h1>
      Deforestation and forest degradation in tropical forests has grown in
      prominence as priorities for environmental governance in the face of
      climate change, given the large share of forest and land use GHG
      emissions in the national profiles of tropical forest countries ( )
      (Butt et al., 2015; ). This is reflected in Parties’ Nationally
      Determined Contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCCC,
      2021). Significant investments in REDD+ readiness, improved forest
      monitoring, assessments of drivers of deforestation and forest
      degradation and related policy responses, and stakeholder engagement
      have occurred over the past decade in countries across Africa,
      Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean (Hein et al., 2018;
      ; ). Fifty-three percent of countries use the highest-quality remote
      sensing data for forest monitoring and reporting, covering 93% of
      forest cover (Nesha et al., 2021). However, improved monitoring has
      not yet translated into forest governance effectiveness. Since the New
      York Declaration on Forests was endorsed in 2014, average annual humid
      tropical primary forest loss has accelerated by 44% (NYDF, 2019).
      Policy responses towards conservation and ecosystem resilience are
      found to be insufficient to stem the direct and indirect drivers of
      nature deterioration ( ) (IPBES, 2019). For governance measures to be
      effective, it is necessary to alter the direct and underlying drivers
      that are leading to forest destruction or impeding the implementation
      of sustainable forest management practices and actions to restore
      degraded forests ( ) (Section CCP7.2.3; Section CCP7.5; UNFCCC, 2013).
      Private sector commitments to reduce deforestation impacts in their
      commodity supply chains are growing, but evidence of impact is slim
      and inconclusive (Garrett et al., 2019; NYDF, 2019). Half of the
      biodiversity loss associated with consumption in developed economies
      occurs outside their territorial boundaries (Wilting et al., 2017),
      and trends in international trade in land-based production systems are
      increasing, with greatest impacts on tropical forests (Nyström et al.,
      2019; ). In addition, in some cases the impacts of financialisation
      (e.g., correlation of commodity prices with stock market dynamics
      rather than pure demand) are found to be larger than those related to
      timber and agricultural commodity production dynamics ( ; ;
      cross-reference to Chapter 5.13). Such factors present challenges for
      governance and policy responses. The complexity of tackling drivers of
      forest loss and degradation will increase as climate impacts on
      forests and ecosystems intensify in the context of incomplete
      information and limited understanding of risks ( ; Hughes et al.,
      2013; Springmann et al., 2018; Tu et al., 2019), necessitating novel
      approaches to forest governance for resilience ( ; Spathelf et al.,
      2018). Therefore, governance, defined as efforts that seek to
      influence the relationship between existing social processes and
      governance arrangements by using regulatory processes, mechanisms and
      organisations (Agrawal et al., 2018), is a crucial process to convene
      stakeholders for decisions ( ). This section describes seven levers
      that support transformative environmental governance towards
      resilience of tropical forests by tackling the underlying indirect
      drivers, offering policy solutions and governance challenges and
      opportunities. The first five build on IPBES (2019), whereas the
      remaining two are drawn from the governance literature as highly
      relevant variables specific to the tropical forest context owing to
      their prominence in the international frameworks developed over the
      past 10 years (Table CCP7.5). Monitoring and finance are embedded in
      multiple levers. The levers include:
      <ol>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Developing incentives and increased capacity for environmental
          responsibility (particularly in relation to global targets such as
          the SDGs, Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Paris Agreement) and
          discontinuing harmful subsidies and disincentives;
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Reforming sectoral and segmented decision-making to promote
          integration across sectors and jurisdictions to mainstream
          environmental objectives across institutions, within and among all
          relevant sectors;
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Pursuing pre-emptive and precautionary actions in regulatory and
          management institutions and businesses to avoid, mitigate and
          remedy the deterioration of nature and monitor outcomes;
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Managing for resilient social and ecological systems in the face
          of uncertainty and complexity;
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Strengthening environmental laws and policies and their
          implementation, and the rule of law more generally (Pörtner et
          al., 2021);
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Acknowledging land tenure and rights to recognise the need of
          bringing human rights considerations into the climate change
          regime; and
        </li>
<li lang="en-GB">
          Enhancing inclusive stakeholder participation to ensure effective,
          efficient and equitable outcomes (Pasgaard et al., 2016).
        </li>
</ol>
      While the first five levers are relevant to environmental governance
      more broadly, the exploration of these levers in Table CCP7.5 is more
      specific to governance for forest resilience, drawing upon insights
      related to each transformation lever. Next to the governance solutions
      being implemented currently, indications of future
      challenges/opportunities related to resilience in tropical forests are
      explored based on examples from the recent literature. Levers of
      transformative change to tackle the underlying indirect drivers of

<div style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 10px">
        There is increasing evidence of positive impacts of resilient tropical
        forests, biodiversity and sustainable forest management in achieving
        SDGs, as presented in Table Box CCP7.2.1. However, there is also risk
        of unintended consequences based on conflicts between the use of
        forest-based goods and services, and effects on tropical forest
        resilience, ecosystem services and biodiversity ( ). For instance,
        substitution of fossil fuels and non-renewable resources with
        bio-based products can lead to deforestation and the loss of
        biodiversity (Carrasco, 2017) (Cross-Working-Group Box BIOECONOMY in
        Chapter 5). Deforestation as a result of increased agricultural
        production and productivity could hamper efforts in addressing
        long-term food security, particularly for forest-dependent people
        (Newton et al., 2016; Section CCP7.2.3). Synergies and trade-offs
        depend very much on local contexts and are therefore presented in
        exemplary form. estimated that there are 640 million people living
        below the poverty line in rural areas of 43 tropical countries. Poor
        communities rely on ecosystem services for their subsistence
        livelihoods, and often they have limited capacity to adapt to change,
        making them more vulnerable to climate change and other forms of
        changes (Bhatta, 2015). Managing forests sustainably benefits both
        urban and rural communities, including provision of food and fibre,
        and on watershed hydrology and agroforestry production, among others
        (Powell et al., 2013; Dawson et al., 2014; , Mbow et al., 2014) (Table
        Box CCP7.2.1). Examples from sustainable tropical forest management
        (STFM) in achieving SDGs.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
   FAQ CCP7.1 | How is climate change affecting
    tropical forests and what can we do to protect and increase their
    resilience? In addition to climate change, tropical forests are
    experiencing non-climatic stressors. Conversion of forest into
    large-scale agriculture land and exploitation of timber and non-timber
    forest products are increasing pressure and amplifying the impacts of
    climate change on the remaining areas of tropical forests. These include
    biodiversity decline, increases of fires, large-scale ecosystem
    transformation (e.g., into savannah in southeastern Amazon) and
    increasing carbon emissions due to deforestation, forest conversion and
    forest degradation. Further, loss of forest resources leads to the
    decline of livelihoods of Indigenous Peoples and local communities. All
    nations need to collaborate to implement collective actions to protect
    tropical forests. Tropical forests are essentially important for the
    health of planet Earth. Tropical forests in Asia, Africa and South
    America regulate carbon, water and chemical cycles, which maintain a
    healthy climate and nutrient cycles for supporting life. Tropical
    forests are home to two-thirds of our world’s biodiversity, although
    they cover only about 13% of the land on Earth, but it is not known
    exactly how many millions of living creatures, such as microorganisms,
    insects, amphibians, snakes, fish, birds, mammals and primates, live in
    tropical forests. Approximately 1.3 billion people directly depend upon
    tropical forest resources to survive. Others are indirectly dependent
    upon the health and provisioning of ecosystem services and goods from
    tropical forests. The forests provide many kinds of economic products,
    such as timber, medicines and food, and recreational services, such as
    nature trekking, bird and wildlife watching, to mention a few.
    Indigenous People and other forest-dependent communities have shown
    extraordinary knowledge on how to manage forest resources to meet their
    subsistence needs without causing forest degradation. This forest
    culture and wisdom are broken when the rate of forest extraction changes
    into unplanned and unsustainable large-scale transformation.
    Deforestation and land-use changes in tropical forests cause not only
    physical and biological changes on flora and fauna, but also rapid
    changes in cultures harming forest peoples. A degraded tropical forest
    is prone and more vulnerable to climate change. An increase in
    temperature in lowlands creates an unfavourable condition for optimum
    growths of many kinds of plant species which also affects several
    agricultural plants. Coffee farmers, for example, are forced to open new
    forest frontiers in highland areas to meet an optimum temperature for
    the growth of coffee. The onset and duration of dry and rainy seasons
    also changes. A prolonged wet season has excessive rains which cause
    flash floods and substantially disturbs the fruiting cycle of many plant
    species. Due to high rainfall and high humidity, most flowers of forest
    trees fail to mature, and hence essentially deplete fruit production.
    Most trees in tropical forests require a short period of a dry season to
    have a mass fruiting season. On the other hand, a prolonged dry season
    causes soils to dry in deeper layers, higher atmospheric demand for
    water vapour and enhanced forest fires. In the tropical humid forests,
    the majority of forest fires are anthropogenic. In Southeast Asia, peat
    fires cause large carbon emissions and haze pollution which harms locals
    and people in neighbouring countries. The impact on tropical forest
    comes also from the sea level rise which is due to changes in salinity
    and sedimentation rates, and the expansion of inundated areas leads to
    the decline of mangrove productivity. Projected impacts of climate
    change on the tropical forest might be detrimental to safeguards of
    local communities and a significant number of flora and fauna in the
    tropics. In southeastern Amazon, reduction in precipitation, due to
    changes in the climate pattern, associated with intense deforestation
    and land cover change are leading to reduction of productivity in the
    remaining forest areas, and might lead to a large-scale change in the
    forest structure which can become a savannah. In Southeast Asia, in
    particular in Indonesia and Malaysia, prolonged dry seasons associated
    with the El Niño phenomenon cause extensive peat fires, releasing large
    amounts of carbon dioxide and creating various health problems related
    to haze pollution. Furthermore, climate change interacts with
    deforestation for agriculture (crops, livestock and plantation
    forestry), logging, mining or infrastructure development, exacerbating
    temperature and rainfall changes resulting in more degradation. Climate
    change, together with forest fragmentation and deforestation, also harms
    wildlife. For example, the orangutan, an endemic species to tropical
    peat forests in Kalimantan and Sumatra, is classified as critically
    endangered. Many other endemic and unknown species of flora in tropical
    forests are in the same condition and could experience a mass extinction
    at a more rapid rate than the previous five mass extinctions on Earth.
    About 1.3 million Indigenous Peoples depending on the natural resources
    of the tropical forest would suffer from cultural disruption and
    livelihood change due to forest loss. To protect tropical forests a
    collective action of all nations is needed. It requires a global effort
    to stop deforestation and the conversion of tropical forests. The role
    of Indigenous Peoples and local communities as forest keepers must be
    strengthened. Economic incentives for protecting tropical forests, among
    other strategies, could facilitate collective actions towards a
    sustainable management of tropical forests. Sustainable, effective and
    just strategies to increase the resilience of tropical forests need to
    consider the complex political, social and economic dynamics involved,
    including the goals, identity and livelihood priorities of Indigenous
    Peoples and local communities beyond natural resource management.
    Strategies can benefit from integrating knowledge and know-how from
    traditional cultures, fostering transitions towards more sustainable
    systems.
