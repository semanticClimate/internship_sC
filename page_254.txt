Conclusion 
 
Back to where this chapter started.  
Almost.  
 
Just 15 years after the hot air balloon rose up into the sky, the French people rose up to challenge 
and overthrow the ancien regime. Like the hot air balloon, it all started inside Versailles.  
 
Here is the famous painting by Jaques Louis David that framed that famous moment.  
 
 
 
Figure 46, "The Tennis Court Oath", Jaques-Louis David, 1790-1794. 
 
 
If we remember from the very start of Chapter 5, if we look closely at his large gathering of men349, 
we could see copies of Rousseau’s book, “The Social Contract” (1762) stuffed in their back pockets. 
These men were stood, equal, under a big idea. An idea, charged with energy. An idea that dwarfed 
them. This big idea was Rousseau’s “General Will”, or in more familiar vocabulary, democracy, 
justice, the rule of law, equality and rights.  
 
Rousseau was totally committed to a more equal society, not simply out of a concern for justice, but 
most fundamentally, because it was precondition of a society that could be whole and unified. For 
Rousseau, we are our true selves in community. He thought and that collaborative, creative space is 
not possible to achieve across massive fault-lines of inequality and division.   
 
 
349 Yes, arguably Rousseau major failing as a thinker was his retrograde views on women.
