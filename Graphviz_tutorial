### Introduction to Graphviz
## What is Graphviz?
Graphviz is a software that converts text-based descriptions written in the DOT language into visually attractive graphs.

### How to Install Graphviz
1.Go to Graphviz Download.
2.Download and install the setup file.
3.Add Graphviz to the systemâ€™s environment variables.

###  How Graphviz Works (Mechanism)
**Graph creation: Define nodes (entities) and edges (connections) in a .dot file.
**Layout Algorithm: Graphviz uses layout algorithms like dot, neato, and fdp to automatically arrange nodes.
**Rendering: After arranging the nodes, Graphviz converts the graph into image formats like PNG, PDF, or SVG.

### Basic Example of Graphviz Usage
**Step 1:  Create a .dot file
Name the file graph.dot

digraph department {
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue];

    Department [label="Department", shape=ellipse, fillcolor=green];
    Bioinformatics [label="Bioinformatics", shape=box, fillcolor=grey];
    Professor [label="Professor", shape=box];
    Student [label="Student", shape=box];
    Classroom [label="Classroom", shape=diamond, fillcolor=lightyellow];

    Department -> Bioinformatics;
    Department -> Professor;
    Department -> Student;
    Classroom -> Student;
    Classroom -> Professor;
}
**Step 2: Run the Graphviz command
dot -Tpng graph.dot -o graph.png

**Step 3: Output
After running the command, get a graph.png file displaying your diagram.
