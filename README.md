## Current Focus
I am currently working on **IPCC Chapter 10: Linking Global to Regional Climate Change(WG-1)**, this chapter emphasizes that while climate change is a global issue, its impacts vary significantly across regions.


## Workflow  
To process this chapter efficiently, I will follow these steps:  

1. **Summarization** – Extract key insights and condense the chapter into a concise summary.  
2. **Wordlist Extraction** – Identify important terms and concepts relevant to climate change.  
3. **Dictionary Creation** – Organize the extracted words into a structured dictionary with definitions.  
4. **Knowledge Graph Development** – Build a knowledge graph to visualize relationships between key concepts.
