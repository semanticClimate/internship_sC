## Project Overview
I am currently working on **IPCC Working Group 1, Chapter 2: Changing State of the Climate System**. The focus of this project is to develop resources that enhance the understanding of climate-related terminologies and concepts.

## Objectives
- **Wordlist:** Compile a list of key terms and definitions relevant to climate science. (Link: https://github.com/semanticClimate/internship_sC/blob/moobashara/IPCC_Chapter/wordlist.txt)
- **Dictionary:** Provide detailed explanations for climate-related terminologies to improve comprehension. (Link: https://github.com/semanticClimate/internship_sC/blob/moobashara/IPCC_Chapter/dictionary.html)
- **Knowledge Graph:** Create a structured representation of relationships between climate concepts to facilitate knowledge discovery.
