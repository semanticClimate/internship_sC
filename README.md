## Current Focus
I am currently working on **IPCC Chapter 4: Mitigation and development pathways in the near- to mid-term(WG-3)**, which focuses on accelerating mitigation and on shifting development pathways to increased sustainability, based on literature particularly at national scale.

This contains the work progress by the interns and discussion for different tasks.
