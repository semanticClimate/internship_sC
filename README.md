# Project Overview
---
I am currently working on **IPCC Working Group-2, Chapter:7 Health, Wellbeing and the Changing Structure of Communities**.This chapter projects future risks of climate change for health, wellbeing, migration and conflict, taking into consideration determinants of vulnerability and the dynamic structure of human populations and communities. 

# Objectives
---
Summarization: This chapter discusses the increasing health impacts of climate change, including rising diseases, malnutrition, and mental health issues, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. It emphasizes the need for more research on the long-term, cumulative effects of climate change on health and resilience, particularly for vulnerable populations.
