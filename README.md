# Project Overview
---
I am currently working on **IPCC Working Group-2, Chapter:7 Health, Wellbeing and the Changing Structure of Communities**.This chapter projects future risks of climate change for health, wellbeing, migration and conflict, taking into consideration determinants of vulnerability and the dynamic structure of human populations and communities. 

# Objectives
**Summarization**: This chapter discusses the growing health impacts of climate change, which include the rising prevalence of climate-related illnesses, malnutrition, and mental health issues. These effects are particularly severe for vulnerable populations such as women, children, the elderly, and indigenous communities. The chapter emphasizes the urgent need for further research into the long-term and cumulative effects of climate change on both health and resilience, with a specific focus on how these challenges affect at-risk groups. Climate change is also driving shifts in migration patterns, as people are displaced due to extreme weather events, often leading to internal migration. Additionally, the risk of violent conflict is increasing, as climate stressors interact with existing political and resource-related tensions. Effective adaptation strategies—such as building resilient health systems, improving urban infrastructure, and addressing food and water security—are essential to mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. However, overcoming challenges such as inequalities in access to resources and adaptation measures is crucial in reducing vulnerabilities and promoting sustainable resilience for all populations.
