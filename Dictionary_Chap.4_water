            { name: "Aquifer", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquifer", img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Groundwater_depletion.png", desc: "An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing rock. It stores groundwater that can be accessed through wells and springs. Aquifers play a crucial role in supplying fresh water to people, especially in arid regions. They can be made of porous rock, sand, or gravel. Overuse of aquifers can lead to depletion and land subsidence. Many aquifers take thousands of years to recharge naturally. Pollution from chemicals can contaminate aquifers, making the water unsafe for drinking. Sustainable management of aquifers is essential for long-term water security. Climate change and population growth are increasing pressure on aquifers. Protecting them is key to ensuring clean water for future generations." },
            { name: "Drought", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Drought.jpg", desc: "A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall. It leads to water shortages that affect agriculture, drinking water supplies, and ecosystems. Droughts can be caused by climate patterns such as El NiÃ±o. Severe droughts can lead to desertification, where fertile land becomes dry and barren. Crops fail during droughts, causing food shortages and economic losses. Many regions implement water conservation measures during droughts. Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of droughts worldwide. Droughts also increase the risk of wildfires by making vegetation dry and flammable. Water-saving technologies like rainwater harvesting help mitigate drought impacts. Communities must prepare for droughts through better water management strategies." },
            { name: "Flood", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flooding", img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Flooding.jpg", desc: "Flooding occurs when water overflows onto normally dry land. It can result from heavy rainfall, river overflow, storm surges, or melting snow. Floods damage homes, roads, and farmland, leading to economic losses. Flash floods happen suddenly due to intense rainfall in a short period. Coastal flooding is caused by hurricanes and rising sea levels. Floods can spread waterborne diseases and contaminate drinking water sources. Deforestation and poor land management increase the risk of flooding. Building flood defenses, such as levees and reservoirs, helps reduce damage. Early warning systems and emergency plans save lives during floods. Climate change is making extreme weather events, including floods, more common." },
            { name: "Glacier", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier", img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Water_cycle.png", desc: "A glacier is a massive, slow-moving body of ice that forms from compressed snow. Glaciers store about 69% of the world's freshwater. They slowly flow over land, shaping valleys and landscapes. As they melt, they release freshwater into rivers and lakes. Many communities rely on glacier meltwater for drinking and irrigation. Rising global temperatures are causing glaciers to shrink rapidly. Glacier retreat affects water supply and increases sea levels. Scientists study glaciers to understand past climate changes. Some glaciers are thousands of years old and contain ancient air bubbles. Protecting glaciers is crucial to maintaining global water balance." },
            { name: "Groundwater", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater", img: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Groundwater_depletion.png", desc: "Groundwater is water found beneath the Earth's surface in soil and rock layers. It is a crucial source of fresh water for drinking, irrigation, and industry. Many rural communities depend entirely on groundwater for survival. It is replenished by rainfall that seeps into the ground through porous soil. Groundwater pollution from chemicals and waste can make it unsafe to drink. Over-extraction of groundwater can cause wells to dry up. Land subsidence occurs when excessive groundwater removal causes the ground to sink. Monitoring groundwater levels helps prevent shortages and contamination. Climate change affects groundwater recharge rates, impacting its availability. Sustainable management ensures groundwater remains a reliable resource for future generations." }
