and Fred Singer; their story mirrors that of “Deutsche Physik” of the early 20th century (see textbox).

Kahan’s scatterplot graphs below show how consistent risk assessments are for various issues for 
both Democrats and Republicans.  Whenever government intervention is potentially involved in an 
issue there is a polarisation of the risks perceived by people of different political orientation. In the 
case of ‘Global warming’, ‘Private gun possession’ and ‘Fracking,’ all the lines show the Democrats to 
be hotly bothered and the Republicans to be coolly reserved relative to the strength of their

most respondents answer according to their tribe, not their reason. Confirmation of this tendency 
can be seen clearly if the science component of the question is disentangled from the political
