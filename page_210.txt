The celebrated zoologist Konrad Lorenz investigated the instinctive behaviour of geese to bond with the 
first moving object that they see after hatching. Lorenz himself could often be found with a gaggle of 
baby geese around his Wellington Boots. The comic sight of waddling ducklings behaving under the 
influence of a purely ‘System 1’ network is not too dissimilar to the clan mentality of much of the 
public’s scientific reasoning in America. The founding of America was all about an escape from 
government control, and this has remained one of its most basic psychological prints ever since.  
 
Kahan’s graph show how strong this ‘filial imprinting’ can be in human thinking. Admittedly, the USA 
might be a peculiarly conflicted nation in its commitment to open markets and scientific research on the 
one hand and closed, widespread populism and religious dogmatism on the other.  But no culture is 
immune from skewed reasoning, and every nation has to be smart about its climate communication.
